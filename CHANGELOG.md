# Changelog

All notable changes to Bambuddy will be documented in this file.

## [0.2.1b] - Not released

### Fixed
- **Nozzle Mapping Uses Wrong Source in 3MF Files** — The `extract_nozzle_mapping_from_3mf()` function used `filament_nozzle_map` (user preference) as the primary source for nozzle assignments. BambuStudio's "Auto For Flush" mode overrides user preferences at slice time, so the actual assignment lives in the `group_id` attribute on `<filament>` elements in `slice_info.config`. Now uses `group_id` as the primary source and falls back to `filament_nozzle_map` only when `group_id` is not present.
- **Print Scheduler Hard-Filters Nozzle When No Trays on Target Nozzle** — On dual-nozzle printers, the scheduler enforced a strict nozzle filter when matching filaments. If a slicer filament was assigned to a nozzle with no AMS trays (e.g., only external spool on left nozzle), the match failed even though the filament existed on the other nozzle. Now falls back to unfiltered matching when no trays exist on the target nozzle.
- **Print Scheduler External Spool Ignores Nozzle Assignment** — The external spool fallback in the scheduler always mapped to extruder 0 (right), ignoring the slicer's nozzle assignment. Now uses the 3MF nozzle mapping to select the correct extruder for external spool matches.
- **ams_extruder_map Race Condition on Printer Status API** — The `/printers/{id}/status` endpoint read `ams_extruder_map` from the MQTT state without checking if the AMS data had been received yet. On fresh connections before the first AMS push-all, this returned an empty map — causing the frontend nozzle filter to show all trays as unfiltered. Now returns an empty object gracefully and the frontend disables nozzle filtering until the map is populated.
- **Filament Mapping Frontend Ignores Nozzle for External Spools** — The `useFilamentMapping` hook always set `extruder_id: 0` for external spool matches. Now uses the nozzle mapping from the 3MF file to determine the correct extruder.
- **AMS-HT Global Tray ID Computed Wrong on Printer Card** — The PrintersPage computed AMS-HT tray IDs using `ams_id * 4 + slot` (giving 512+), but AMS-HT units use their raw `ams_id` (128-135) as the global tray ID. Now uses `ams_id` directly for AMS-HT units.
- **Filament Mapping Dropdown Shows Wrong Nozzle Trays** — The FilamentMapping dropdown filtered by `extruder_id` using strict equality, but `extruder_id` could be `undefined` for printers that hadn't reported their AMS extruder map yet. This caused all trays to be hidden. Now skips nozzle filtering when `extruder_id` is undefined.
- **Cancelled Print Usage Tracking Uses Stale Progress/Layer** — When a print was cancelled, the usage tracker read `mc_percent` and `layer_num` from the printer's MQTT state — but by the time the `on_print_complete` callback ran, the printer had already reset these to 0. Now captures the last valid progress and layer values during printing, and the usage tracker reads these captured values on cancellation for accurate partial usage.
- **H2D Tray Disambiguation Triggers on Single-Nozzle Printers** — The `tray_now <= 3` check for H2D dual-nozzle disambiguation matched any printer loading from AMS 0 (trays 0-3). On P2S, X1C, and X1E with multiple AMS units, this caused warning log spam every second. Now uses a persistent `_is_dual_nozzle` flag detected from `device.extruder.info` (>= 2 entries), which only dual-nozzle printers (H2D, H2D Pro) report.
- **AMS-HT Snow Slot Mismatch Log Spam on H2D** — The snow-based tray_now disambiguation computed `snow_slot = -1` for AMS-HT trays (IDs 128-135), causing a "slot mismatch" debug log on every MQTT update even though the result was correct. Now correctly computes `snow_slot = 0` for AMS-HT single-slot units.
- **Color Tooltip Clipped Behind Adjacent Swatches** — Color swatch hover tooltips in the spool form were rendered behind neighboring swatches due to missing z-index on the hover state. Added `hover:z-20` and tooltip `z-20` classes.

- **Usage Tracking Wrong Spool on Dual-Nozzle / Multi-AMS Printers** ([#364](https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy/issues/364)) — On H2C, H2D Pro, and other dual-nozzle printers with multiple AMS units, the usage tracker attributed filament consumption to the wrong spools. The MQTT `mapping` field — a per-print array that maps slicer filament slots to physical AMS trays — was preserved in state but never parsed or used. The tracker fell back to `slot_id - 1` as the global tray ID, which is incorrect when AMS hardware IDs differ from sequential indices (e.g., AMS-HT units with ID 128). Now decodes the MQTT mapping field from its snow encoding (`ams_hw_id * 256 + local_slot`) into bambuddy global tray IDs and uses it as a universal mapping source — working for all printer models and all print sources (slicer, queue, reprint) without relying on `tray_now` disambiguation.
- **npm audit: suppress moderate ajv ReDoS finding** — Added `audit-level=high` to `frontend/.npmrc` so `npm audit` exits cleanly. The ajv@6 ReDoS (GHSA-2g4f-4pwh-qvx6) is a transitive dependency of eslint@9 with no patched v6 release; ajv@8 override breaks eslint. The vulnerability requires crafted `$data` schema input — not an attack vector in a linting config.
- **Spool Form Allows Empty Brand & Subtype** ([#417](https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy/issues/417)) — The spool add/edit modal did not require Brand or Subtype fields, allowing spools to be saved without them. When such a spool was assigned to an AMS slot, the `tray_sub_brands` sent to the printer was incomplete (e.g., just "PETG" instead of "PETG Basic"), causing BambuStudio to not recognize the filament profile. Brand and Subtype are now mandatory fields with validation errors shown on submit.
- **Open in Slicer Fails When Authentication Enabled** ([#421](https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy/issues/421)) — The "Open in Slicer" buttons for BambuStudio and OrcaSlicer failed with "importing failed" when authentication was enabled. Slicer protocol handlers (`bambustudio://`, `orcaslicer://`) launch the slicer app which fetches the file via HTTP — but cannot send authentication headers, so the global auth middleware returned 401. Additionally, the URL format was wrong on Linux (used the macOS-only `bambustudioopen://` scheme instead of `bambustudio://open?file=`). Fixed with short-lived, single-use download tokens: the frontend fetches a token via an authenticated POST endpoint, then builds a `/dl/{token}/{filename}` URL that the slicer can access without auth headers. The token is validated server-side (5-minute expiry, single-use). Platform-specific URL formats now match the actual slicer source code: macOS uses `bambustudioopen://` with URL encoding, Windows/Linux use `bambustudio://open?file=`, and OrcaSlicer uses `orcaslicer://open?file=`.

### Changed
- **Filament Catalog API Renamed** ([#427](https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy/issues/427)) — Renamed `/api/v1/filaments/` to `/api/v1/filament-catalog/` to avoid confusion with the inventory spools page (labeled "Filament" in the UI). The old endpoint managed material type definitions (cost, temperature, density), not physical spools — the shared name caused users to expect the API to return their spool inventory.

### Improved
- **AMS Mapping Test Coverage** — Added 63 backend tests for scheduler AMS mapping (nozzle filtering, external spool extruder assignment, fallback behavior) and 43 frontend tests for `useFilamentMapping` hook (nozzle-aware matching, AMS-HT handling, external spool extruder logic).
- **Tray Now Disambiguation Test Coverage** — Added 28 MQTT message replay tests covering all `tray_now` disambiguation paths: single-nozzle passthrough (X1E/P2S), H2D dual-nozzle snow field, pending target, `ams_extruder_map` fallback, active extruder switching, and full multi-color print lifecycles.


## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-17

### New Features
- **Bed Cooled Notification** ([#378](https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy/issues/378)) — New notification event that fires when the print bed cools below a configurable threshold (default 35°C) after a print completes. Useful for knowing when it's safe to remove parts. A background task polls the bed temperature every 15 seconds after print completion and sends a notification when it drops below the threshold. Automatically cancels if a new print starts or the printer disconnects. The threshold is configurable in Settings → Notifications. Includes a customizable notification template with printer name, bed temperature, and threshold variables.
- **Spool Inventory — AMS Slot Assignment** — Assign inventory spools to AMS slots for filament tracking. Hover over any non-Bambu-Lab AMS slot to assign or unassign spools. The assign modal filters out Bambu Lab spools (tracked via RFID) and spools already assigned to other slots. Bambu Lab spool slots automatically hide assign/unassign UI since they are managed by the AMS. When a Bambu Lab spool is inserted into a slot with a manual assignment, the assignment is automatically unlinked.
- **Spool Inventory — Remaining Weight Editing** — Edit the remaining filament weight when adding or editing a spool. The new "Remaining Weight" field in the Additional section shows current weight (label weight minus consumed) with a max reference. Edits are stored as `weight_used` internally.
- **Spool Inventory — Unified 3MF-Based Usage Tracking** ([#336](https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy/issues/336)) — All spools (Bambu Lab and third-party) now use 3MF slicer estimates as the primary tracking source. Per-filament `used_g` data from the archived 3MF file provides precise per-spool consumption. For failed or aborted prints, per-layer G-code analysis provides accurate partial usage up to the exact failure layer, with linear progress scaling as fallback. AMS remain% delta is the final fallback for G-code-only prints without an archived 3MF. Slot-to-tray mapping uses queue `ams_mapping` for queue-initiated prints and the printer's `tray_now` state for single-filament non-queue prints, ensuring the correct physical spool is always tracked.
- **Notification Templates — Filament Usage Variables** ([#336](https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy/issues/336)) — `print_complete`, `print_failed`, and `print_stopped` notification events now expose `{filament_grams}` (total grams, scaled by progress for partial prints), `{filament_details}` (per-filament breakdown with AMS slot info, e.g. "AMS-A T1 PLA: 12.4g | AMS-A T3 PETG: 2.8g"), and `{progress}` (completion percentage for failed/stopped prints). The `{filament_details}` variable includes the AMS unit and tray position for each filament used, with "Ext" shown for external spool holders. Falls back to type-only format (e.g. "PLA: 10.0g") when usage tracking data is unavailable. Webhook payloads include `filament_used`, `filament_details`, and `progress` fields. Per-slot filament data is stored in archive `extra_data` for downstream use.
- **Printer Status Summary Bar — Next Available & Availability Count** ([#354](https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy/issues/354)) — The status bar on the Printers page now shows an availability count ("X available") alongside the printing/offline counts, and a "Next available" indicator showing which printing printer will finish soonest — with printer name, mini progress bar, completion percentage, and remaining time. Useful for print farms to quickly identify the next free printer. Updates in real-time via WebSocket. Translated in all 4 locales (en, de, ja, it).
- **Nozzle-Aware AMS Filament Mapping for Dual-Nozzle Printers** ([#318](https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy/issues/318)) — On dual-nozzle printers (H2D, H2D Pro), each AMS unit is physically connected to either the left or right nozzle. Bambuddy now reads nozzle assignments from the 3MF file (`filament_nozzle_map` + `physical_extruder_map` in `project_settings.config`) and constrains filament matching to only AMS trays connected to the correct nozzle via `ams_extruder_map`. Applies to the print scheduler, reprint modal, queue modal, and multi-printer selection. Falls back gracefully to unfiltered matching when no trays exist on the target nozzle. The filament mapping UI shows L/R nozzle badges for dual-nozzle prints. Translated in all 4 locales (en, de, ja, it).
- **Dual External Spool Support for H2D** — H2-series printers with two external spool holders (Ext-L and Ext-R) are now fully supported. The external spool section renders as a grid with both slots, each showing filament type, color, fill level, and hover card details. Previously only a single external spool was displayed. Applies to the printer card, filament mapping, print scheduler, usage tracking, and inventory assignment. The `vt_tray` field is now an array across the entire stack (MQTT, API, WebSocket, frontend).
- **AMS Slot Configuration — Model Filtering & Pre-Population** — The Configure AMS Slot modal now filters filament presets by the connected printer model. Only presets matching the printer (e.g., "@BBL X1C" presets for X1C printers) and generic presets without a model suffix are shown. Local presets are filtered by their `compatible_printers` field. When re-configuring an already-configured slot, the modal pre-selects the saved preset, pre-populates the color, and auto-selects the active K-profile. The preset list auto-scrolls to the selected item. All modal strings are now fully translated in 5 locales (en, de, fr, it, ja).
- **K-Profiles View — Accurate Filament Name Resolution** — K-profile filament names are now resolved from builtin filament tables and user cloud presets (via new `/cloud/filament-id-map` endpoint) instead of showing raw IDs like "GFU99" or "P4d64437". Falls back to extracting names from the profile name field.
- **Print Log** — New view mode on the Archives page showing a chronological table of all print activity. Columns include date/time, print name, printer, user, status, duration, and filament. Supports filtering by search text, printer, user, status, and date range. Pagination with configurable page size. A dedicated clear button deletes only log entries without affecting archives. Data is stored in a separate `print_log_entries` database table.
- **Sync Spool Weights from AMS** — New button in Settings → Filament Tracking (built-in inventory mode) to force-sync all inventory spool weights from the live AMS remain% values of connected printers. Overwrites the database weight data with current sensor readings. Useful for recovering from corrupted weight data (e.g., after a power-off event zeroed all fill levels). Requires printers to be online. Includes a confirmation modal.
- **Notification Thumbnails for Telegram & ntfy** ([#372](https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy/issues/372)) — Print thumbnail images are now attached to Telegram and ntfy notifications (previously only Pushover and Discord). Telegram uses the `sendPhoto` API with the image as caption attachment. ntfy sends the image as a binary PUT with `Filename` and `Message` headers. No configuration needed — images are sent automatically when available.
- **Clear HMS Errors** — New "Clear Errors" button in the HMS error modal sends a `clean_print_error` MQTT command to dismiss stale `print_error` values that persist after print cancellation or transient events. Locally clears the error list for immediate UI feedback. Permission-gated to `printers:control`. The button only appears when there are active errors.

### Fixed
- **Firmware Upload Uses Wrong Filename on Cache Hit** — The firmware update uploader cached downloaded firmware files under a mangled name (e.g., `X1C_01_09_00_10.bin`) instead of the original filename from Bambu Lab's CDN. On the first download the correct filename was uploaded to the SD card, but on subsequent attempts the cached file with the wrong name was used — causing the printer to not recognize the firmware file. Now caches using the original filename so the SD card always receives the correct file.
- **Update Check Runs When Disabled** ([#367](https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy/issues/367)) — The Settings page triggered an update check on every visit even when "Check for updates" was disabled, causing error popups on air-gapped systems with no internet. The backend `/updates/check` endpoint also ignored the setting entirely. Now the backend returns early without making GitHub API calls when the setting is disabled, the Settings page respects the `check_updates` flag before auto-fetching, and the printer card firmware badge shows a neutral version-only display instead of disappearing when firmware update checks are off.
- **Stale Inventory Assignments Persist After Switching to Spoolman Mode** — When switching from built-in inventory to Spoolman mode, existing spool-to-AMS-slot assignments were not cleaned up. The printer card hover cards continued showing "Assign Spool" buttons that opened the internal inventory modal, and any prior assignments remained visible. Now bulk-deletes all `SpoolAssignment` records when enabling Spoolman, invalidates the frontend cache so printer cards update immediately, and hides the inventory assign/unassign UI on printer cards while in Spoolman mode.
- **Bulk Archive Delete Leaves Orphaned Database Records** — When bulk-deleting archives, the files were removed from disk before the database commit. If concurrent SQLite writes caused a lock timeout, the commit failed and rolled back — leaving database records pointing to deleted files (broken thumbnails, 404 errors). Fixed by deleting the database record first and only removing files after a successful commit.
- **Model-Specific Maintenance Tasks for Carbon Rods vs Linear Rails** ([#351](https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy/issues/351)) — Maintenance tasks "Clean Carbon Rods" and "Lubricate Linear Rails" were shown for all printers regardless of motion system. H2 and A1 series use linear rails (not carbon rods), and X1/P1/P2S series use carbon rods (not linear rails). Maintenance types are now classified by rod/rail type: "Lubricate Carbon Rods" and "Clean Carbon Rods" for X1/P1/P2S, "Lubricate Linear Rails" and "Clean Linear Rails" for A1/H2. Stale and duplicate system types are automatically cleaned up on startup. Includes model-specific wiki links and i18n keys for all 4 locales.
- **AMS Slot Configuration Overwritten on Startup** — Bambuddy was resetting AMS slot filament presets on every startup and reconnection. The `on_ams_change` callback unconditionally unlinked Bambu Lab spool assignments on each MQTT push-all response, then re-assigned them by sending `ams_filament_setting` without a `setting_id`, which cleared the printer's filament preset. Now compares spool RFID identifiers (`tray_uuid` / `tag_uid`) before unlinking — if the same spool is still in the slot, the assignment is preserved and no `ams_filament_setting` command is sent.
- **Bambu Lab Spool Detection False Positives** — The `is_bambu_lab_spool()` function (backend) and `isBambuLabSpool()` (frontend) incorrectly identified third-party spools as Bambu Lab spools when they used Bambu generic filament presets (e.g., "Generic PLA"). The `tray_info_idx` field (e.g., "GFA00") identifies the filament *type*, not the spool manufacturer — third-party spools using Bambu presets also have GF-prefixed values. Removed `tray_info_idx` from detection logic; now uses only hardware RFID identifiers (`tray_uuid` and `tag_uid`) which are physically embedded in genuine Bambu Lab spools.
- **FTP Disconnect Raises EOFError When Server Dies** — `BambuFTPClient.disconnect()` only caught `OSError` and `ftplib.Error`, but `quit()` raises `EOFError` when the server has closed the connection mid-session. `EOFError` is not a subclass of either, so it propagated to callers. Now caught alongside the other exception types for clean best-effort disconnect.
- **RFID Spool Data Erased by Periodic AMS Updates** — Periodic MQTT push-all responses cleared `tag_uid` and `tray_uuid` fields because they were included in the "always update" list. These fields are now preserved during updates and only cleared when a spool is physically removed (slot clearing detected by empty `tray_type`). This fixes the AMS "eye" icon disappearing for RFID spools after startup.
- **AMS Slot Configuration Overwrites RFID Spool State** — Configuring an AMS slot for an RFID-detected Bambu Lab spool sent `ams_set_filament_setting`, which replaced the firmware's RFID-managed filament config with a manual one — causing the slicer's "eye" icon to change to a "pen" icon. Now detects RFID spools and skips the filament setting command, only sending K-profile selection.
- **K-Profile Selection Corrupts Existing Profiles on X1C/P1S** — The `extrusion_cali_sel` command included a `setting_id` field that BambuStudio never sends, causing firmware to mislink calibration data. The `extrusion_cali_set` command was sent unconditionally, overwriting existing profile metadata. Now `setting_id` is removed from selection commands, and `extrusion_cali_set` is only sent when no existing profile is selected (`cali_idx < 0`).
- **AMS Slot Configure — Black Filament Color Not Pre-Populated** — When re-opening the Configure AMS Slot modal for a slot with black filament, the color field was empty despite the preset and K-profile being correctly pre-selected. The color pre-population logic excluded hex `000000` (black) as a guard against empty slots, but empty slots already skip color data entirely. Removed the unnecessary check so black is now pre-populated like any other color.
- **Archive List View Not Labeling Failed Prints** ([#365](https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy/issues/365)) — The archive grid view displayed a red "Failed" / "Cancelled" badge on failed and aborted prints, but the list view had no equivalent indicator. Now shows an inline status badge next to the print name in list view.
- **Reprint Fails with SD Card Error for Archives Without 3MF File** ([#376](https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy/issues/376)) — When a print was sent from an external slicer and Bambuddy couldn't download the 3MF from the printer during auto-archiving, the fallback archive had no file. Attempting to reprint such an archive tried to upload the data directory as a file, causing a confusing "SD card error." The backend now returns a clear error for file-less archives, and the frontend disables Print/Schedule/Open in Slicer buttons with a tooltip explaining that the 3MF file is unavailable.
- **Inventory Spool Weight Resets After Print Completes** — After a print, the usage tracker correctly updated `weight_used` (e.g., +1.6g), but periodic AMS status updates recalculated `weight_used` from the AMS remain% sensor and overwrote the precise value. For small prints on large spools (e.g., 1.6g on 1000g), the AMS remain% stays at 100% (integer resolution = 10g steps), resetting `weight_used` back to 0. The AMS weight sync now only increases `weight_used`, never decreases it, preserving precise values from the usage tracker.
- **All Spool Fill Levels Drop to Zero When Printers Power Off** — When a printer powers off, the AMS sensor can report `remain=0` for all trays while `tray_type` is still populated. The weight sync treated 0% remain as "100% consumed," computing `weight_used = label_weight` (e.g., 1000g). The "only increase" guard passed because `label_weight > current_used + 1`, marking every assigned spool as fully consumed. The AMS weight sync now skips `remain=0` entirely — a physically empty spool is tracked by the usage tracker during the print, not by a transient AMS sensor reading.
- **Spool Edit Form Overwrites Usage-Tracked Weight** — Editing any spool field (note, color, material, etc.) sent the full form data back to the server, including `weight_used`. If the frontend cache was stale (e.g., loaded before the last print completed), saving the form would silently reset `weight_used` to the pre-print value, reverting the remaining weight to full. The form now only includes `weight_used` in the update request when the user explicitly changes the weight field.
- **K-Profile Auto-Select Fails for Non-BL Spools on Dual-Nozzle Printers** — When assigning a third-party spool to an AMS slot on dual-nozzle printers (H2D, H2D Pro), the MQTT auto-configure step crashed with `'SpoolKProfile' object has no attribute 'extruder_id'`. The K-profile model uses `extruder` (not `extruder_id`). Fixed the attribute name so K-profile matching correctly filters by nozzle on dual-extruder printers.
- **Loose Archive Name Matching Could Cause Wrong Archive Reuse** ([#374](https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy/issues/374)) — The `on_print_start` callback used `ilike('%{name}%')` to find existing "printing" archives, which meant a print named "Clip" could incorrectly match "Cable Clip" or "Clip Stand". This could cause a new print to reuse the wrong archive or skip creating one. Tightened to exact `print_name` match or exact filename variants (`.3mf`, `.gcode.3mf`).
- **Phantom Prints on Power Cycle** ([#374](https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy/issues/374)) — The print queue uploaded `.3mf` files to the printer's SD card root (`/`) but never deleted them after the print finished. Some printers (e.g. P1S) auto-start files found in the root directory on power cycle, causing ghost prints on every reboot. Now deletes the uploaded file from the SD card after print completion (best-effort, non-blocking). The cleanup also tries `.gcode` files and retries up to 3 times with a 2-second delay to handle printers that briefly lock the filesystem after a print ends. Runs before the archive lookup so it works even when auto-archiving is disabled.
- **Queue Items Stuck in "Printing" After Print Completes** — The queue item status update (from `printing` to `completed`/`failed`) was placed after an early return that exits when the archive record cannot be found. If the archive lookup failed (e.g. app restart mid-print, manual archive deletion), the function returned early and the queue item stayed in `printing` forever. Over multiple print cycles, stale items accumulated — causing the "Printing" count to show double the actual printers and completed prints to remain in the "Currently Printing" section. Moved the queue item status update (including MQTT relay notification, queue-completed notification, and auto-power-off) to before the archive lookup early return so it always runs.
- **Spool Form Scrollbar Flicker in Edge** ([#364](https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy/issues/364)) — The Add/Edit Spool modal's scrollable area used `overflow-y: auto`, which on Windows Edge (where scrollbars take layout space) caused the scrollbar to appear and disappear on hover — making the color picker unusable at certain zoom levels. Added `scrollbar-gutter: stable` to reserve scrollbar space and prevent layout thrashing.
- **Archive Duplicate Badge Misses Name-Based Duplicates** ([#315](https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy/issues/315)) — The duplicate badge on archive cards only matched by file content hash, so re-sliced prints of the same model (different GCODE, same print name) were not flagged as duplicates. Now also matches by print name (case-insensitive), consistent with the detail view's duplicate detection.
- **Schedule Print Allows No Plate Selected for Multi-Plate Files** ([#394](https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy/issues/394)) — When scheduling a multi-plate file from the file manager, the modal showed a "Selection required" warning but still allowed submission without selecting a plate. The job defaulted to plate 1, but the queue item didn't indicate which plate, and editing showed no plate selected. Now auto-selects the first plate by default when plates load, and the submit button validation applies to both archive and library files.
- **3MF Usage Tracking Broken for Queue Prints from File Manager** ([#364](https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy/issues/364)) — When a print was queued from the file manager (library file), the scheduler did not create an archive or register the expected print. The `on_print_start` callback had to re-download the 3MF from the printer via FTP, and if that failed, a fallback archive was created without the 3MF file — making 3MF-based filament usage tracking impossible. The queue item's `archive_id` also remained NULL, so the usage tracker could not find the queue's AMS slot mapping for correct spool resolution. The scheduler now creates an archive from the library file before uploading, links it to the queue item, and registers it as an expected print — matching the behavior of the direct library print route.
- **Printer Queue Widget Shows "Archive #null" for File Manager Prints** ([#364](https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy/issues/364)) — The "Next in queue" widget on the printer card only checked `archive_name` and `archive_id` when displaying the queued item name. Queue items from the file manager have `library_file_name` and `library_file_id` instead, so the widget displayed "Archive #null". Now falls back to `library_file_name` and `library_file_id`, matching the Queue page display logic.
- **Inventory Usage Not Tracked for Remapped AMS Slots** ([#364](https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy/issues/364)) — When reprinting an archive with a different AMS slot mapping (e.g. changing from slot A1 to C4 in the mapping modal), the usage tracker used the default 3MF slot-to-tray mapping instead of the actual mapping from the print command. The `ams_mapping` from reprint, library print, and queue print commands is now stored and used as the highest-priority mapping source for usage tracking.
- **Inventory Usage Not Tracked for Slicer-Initiated Prints on H2D** ([#364](https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy/issues/364)) — On H2D printers, the AMS `tray_now` field is always 255 in MQTT data. The actual tray is resolved via the snow field ~44 seconds after print start, but reverts to "unloaded" when the AMS retracts filament at completion. The usage tracker now tracks `last_loaded_tray` — the last valid tray seen during printing — as a fallback when both `tray_now` at start and at completion are invalid. Also captures `tray_now` at print start for printers that report a valid value before the RUNNING state.
- **Inventory Usage Wrong Tray for Slicer-Initiated Prints** ([#364](https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy/issues/364)) — When a print was started from an external slicer (BambuStudio, OrcaSlicer, Bambu Handy), Bambuddy never saw the `ams_mapping` the slicer sent, because it only subscribed to the printer's report topic. The usage tracker fell back to `tray_now` which could resolve to the wrong AMS tray (e.g., Black PLA at A2 instead of Green PLA at A4 on H2D Pro). Now subscribes to the MQTT request topic to intercept print commands from any source, capturing the `ams_mapping` universally — regardless of who starts the print. The request topic subscription is fail-safe: if the printer's MQTT broker rejects it (e.g., P1S), Bambuddy detects the rejection via SUBACK or disconnect timing and gracefully disables the subscription for that printer, falling back to the existing `tray_now`-based tracking without breaking the MQTT connection.
- **P1S Timelapse Not Detected — AVI Format Support** ([#405](https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy/issues/405)) — P1-series printers save timelapse videos as `.avi` (MJPEG), but the timelapse scanner only looked for `.mp4` files — so P1S timelapses were never found or attached to archives. Now discovers both `.mp4` and `.avi` timelapse files across all FTP directories (`/timelapse`, `/timelapse/video`, `/record`, `/recording`). AVI files are saved immediately and converted to MP4 in a non-blocking background task using FFmpeg with `-threads 1` and `nice -n 19` to minimize CPU impact on Raspberry Pi. If FFmpeg is unavailable, the AVI is served as-is with the correct MIME type. The manual "Scan for Timelapse" route also searches the additional directories used by P1-series printers.
- **Timelapse Upload & Remove** ([#406](https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy/issues/406)) — When the auto-scan attaches the wrong timelapse (e.g., from a different print), there was no way to remove it or attach the correct one. Added "Upload Timelapse" and "Remove Timelapse" context menu items. Upload accepts `.mp4`, `.avi`, and `.mkv` files (non-MP4 auto-converted in background). Remove deletes the file and clears the database reference. Both actions are permission-gated and available in grid and list views.
- **Spool Assignments Falsely Unlinked After Print Due to Color Variation** — The auto-unlink logic compared AMS tray colors against saved fingerprints using exact hex match. RFID sensors report slightly different color values across reads (e.g. `7CC4D5FF` vs `56B7E6FF` for the same spool, Euclidean distance ~43.6). Now uses a color similarity function with a tolerance threshold of 50, preventing false unlinks from minor RFID/firmware color variations while still detecting genuinely different spools.

### Improved
- **Virtual Printer: Port 3000 Bind/Detect Server** — Recent BambuStudio/OrcaSlicer updates require a bind/detect handshake on port 3000 before connecting via MQTT/FTP. Added a BindServer that responds to the slicer's detect protocol in all server modes (immediate, review, print_queue). Without this, slicers cannot discover or connect to the virtual printer. Docker users in bridge mode need to expose port 3000 (`-p 3000:3000`). Proxy mode already forwards port 3000 via TCPProxy. Wiki documentation updated with revised port tables, Docker examples, and platform setup instructions.
- **Usage Tracking Diagnostic Logging** ([#364](https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy/issues/364)) — Added INFO-level logging at print start and completion that dumps the printer's MQTT `mapping` field, `tray_now`, `last_loaded_tray`, all mapping-related raw data keys, and per-AMS-tray summaries (type, color, tray_now, tray_tar). Enables investigating the slot-to-tray mapping behavior across different printer models (X1E, H2D Pro, P1S, etc.) without requiring DEBUG mode.
- **Skip Objects: Click-to-Enlarge Lightbox** ([#396](https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy/issues/396)) — The skip objects modal's small 208px image panel made it difficult to distinguish object markers when parts are small or close together. Clicking the image now opens a fullscreen lightbox overlay with the same image and markers at a much larger size (up to 600px). The 24px marker circles are proportionally smaller relative to the enlarged image, solving the overlap problem. Close via X button, Escape key, or clicking the backdrop. Escape cascades correctly — closes lightbox first, then the modal.
- **Phantom Print Investigation — Logging & Hardening** ([#374](https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy/issues/374)) — Added targeted logging and hardening to help diagnose reports of prints starting automatically without user input. Debug log volume reduced ~90% by suppressing `sqlalchemy.engine` (changed from INFO to WARNING) and `aiosqlite` (new WARNING suppression) noise that previously filled 2.5MB in 16 minutes. Every `start_print()` call now logs a `PRINT COMMAND` trace with the caller's file, line, and function name. The print scheduler logs pending queue items when found. `on_print_complete` warns when multiple queue items are in "printing" status for the same printer, which signals a state inconsistency.
- **Reduce Log Noise from MQTT Diagnostics** ([#365](https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy/issues/365)) — Downgraded 58 high-frequency MQTT diagnostic messages from INFO to DEBUG level. Payload dumps, detector state changes, field discovery logs, H2D disambiguation, and periodic status updates no longer flood the log at the default INFO level. Also suppresses paho-mqtt library INFO messages in production. User-initiated actions (print start/stop, AMS load/unload, calibration) remain at INFO. All diagnostic detail is still available when debug logging is enabled.
- **SQLite WAL Mode for Database Reliability** — Database now uses Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) mode with a 5-second busy timeout, reducing "database is locked" errors under concurrent access. WAL mode allows simultaneous reads during writes, improving responsiveness for multi-printer setups. Automatically enabled on startup.
- **External Camera Not Used for Snapshot + Stream Dropping** ([#325](https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy/issues/325)) — The snapshot endpoint (`/camera/snapshot`) always used the internal printer camera even when an external camera was configured. Now checks for external camera first, matching the existing stream endpoint behavior. Also fixed external MJPEG and RTSP streams silently dropping every ~60 seconds due to missing reconnect logic — the underlying stream generators exit on read timeout, and the caller now retries up to 3 times with a 2-second delay instead of ending the stream.
- **H2C Nozzle Rack Text Unreadable on Light Filament Colors** ([#300](https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy/issues/300)) — Nozzle rack slots use the loaded filament color as background, but white/light filaments made the white "0.4" text nearly invisible. Now uses a luminance check to switch to dark text on light backgrounds.
- **File Downloads Show Generic Filenames** ([#334](https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy/issues/334)) — Downloaded files with special characters in their names (spaces, umlauts, parentheses) were saved as generic `file_1`, `file_2` instead of the original filename. The `Content-Disposition` header parser now handles RFC 5987 percent-encoded filenames (`filename*=utf-8''...`) used by FastAPI for non-ASCII characters. Fix applied to all download endpoints (library files, archives, source files, F3D files, project exports, support bundles, printer files).
- **Printer Card Cover Image Not Updating Between Prints** — The cover image on the printer card only refreshed on page reload. The `<img>` URL was always the same (`/printers/{id}/cover`) regardless of which print was active, so the browser served its cached image. Now appends the print name as a cache-busting query parameter so the browser fetches the new cover when a different print starts.
- **Telegram Bold Title Broken by Underscores in Message** ([#332](https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy/issues/332)) — Telegram notifications showed literal `*Title*` asterisks instead of bold text when the message body contained underscores (e.g. job name `A1_plate_8`, error code `0300_0001`). The code was disabling Markdown parsing entirely when underscores were detected. Now escapes underscores in the body with `\_` so Markdown rendering stays enabled.
- **Queued Jobs Incorrectly Archived After Duplicate Execution Detection** ([#341](https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy/issues/341)) — When the same file was added to the print queue multiple times, only the first job executed. All subsequent jobs were automatically skipped with "already printed X hours ago" because they shared the same archive reference, and a safety check incorrectly treated them as phantom reprints. The same issue also affected single queue items created from recently completed archives. Removed the overly broad 4-hour duplicate detection check — the crash recovery scenario it guarded against is already handled by the queue item status lifecycle.

### New Features
- **External Links: Open in New Tab** ([#338](https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy/issues/338)) — External sidebar links can now optionally open in a new browser tab instead of an iframe. Sites behind reverse proxies (Traefik, nginx) that send `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN` or CSP `frame-ancestors` headers block iframe embedding, causing "refused to connect" errors. A new "Open in new tab" toggle in the add/edit link modal lets users choose per-link. Keyboard shortcuts (number keys) also respect the setting. Defaults to iframe (existing behavior) for backward compatibility.
- **Print Queue: Clear Plate Confirmation** — When a print finishes or fails and more items are queued, the printer card now shows a "Clear Plate & Start Next" button. The scheduler no longer auto-starts the next print while the printer is in FINISH or FAILED state — the user must confirm the build plate has been cleared first. This prevents prints from starting on a dirty plate. The button respects the `printers:control` permission and is available in all supported languages (en/de/ja).
- **Clear Plate State Persists Across Page Refresh** ([#410](https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy/issues/410)) — After clicking "Clear Plate & Start Next", refreshing the page showed the Clear Plate button again because the frontend determined the state purely from the printer's FINISH/FAILED status. The `plate_cleared` flag is now included in the printer status API response, so the widget correctly shows the passive queue link instead of the Clear Plate button after acknowledgment — even after a page refresh.

### Improved
- **Skip Objects: Confirmation Dialog** ([#346](https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy/issues/346)) — Added a warning confirmation modal before skipping an object during a print. Shows the object name and warns the action is irreversible. Prevents accidentally skipping the wrong object. Translated in all 4 locales (en, de, ja, it).
- **Additional Currency Options** ([#329](https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy/issues/329), [#333](https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy/issues/333)) — Added 17 additional currencies to the cost tracking dropdown: HKD, INR, KRW, SEK, NOK, DKK, PLN, BRL, TWD, SGD, NZD, MXN, CZK, THB, ZAR, RUB.
- **Move Email Settings Under Authentication Tab** — Renamed the settings "Users" tab to "Authentication" and moved the standalone "Global Email" tab into it as an "Email Authentication" sub-tab. Groups email/SMTP configuration with user management where it logically belongs. Legacy `?tab=email` URLs are handled automatically.
- **Inventory — Confirmation Modals for Delete & Archive** — The inventory page now uses the app's styled confirmation modal for both delete and archive actions. Previously, delete used the browser's native `confirm()` dialog and archive had no confirmation at all. Delete shows a danger-styled modal, archive shows a warning-styled modal. Translated in all 5 locales (en, de, fr, it, ja).
- **Default Color Catalog Expanded to 638 Colors Across 20 Brands** — The built-in filament color catalog has been expanded from 258 entries (6 brands) to 638 entries (20 brands). Added Overture, Sunlu, Creality, Elegoo, Jayo, Inland, Eryone, ColorFabb, Fillamentum, FormFutura, Fiberlogy, MatterHackers, Protopasta, 3DXTECH, and Sakata3D. eSUN expanded from 10 generic placeholder entries to 79 measured colors across 10 material lines (PLA+, Pro PLA+, PLA, PLA Silk, PLA Metal, PLA-ST, PETG, PETG-HS, ABS, ABS+). All hex codes sourced from FilamentColors.xyz measured swatches.
- **Settings — Built-in Inventory Feature Note** — Added a note in Settings > Filament > Built-in Inventory that third-party spools can be assigned to inventory spools for tracking.
- **Catalog Settings Cards Taller** — Spool Catalog and Color Catalog settings panels increased from 400px to 600px max height for better browsability with the expanded default catalogs.

## [0.1.9] - 2026-02-10

### New Features
- **Advanced Authentication via Email** ([#322](https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy/pull/322)) — Optional SMTP-based email integration for streamlined user onboarding and self-service password management. Admins configure SMTP settings and create users with just a username and email — the system generates a secure random password and emails it directly to the new user. Admins can trigger one-click password resets from User Management. Users can reset their own forgotten password from the login screen without contacting an admin. Includes customizable email templates for welcome emails and password resets. Username and email login is case-insensitive. Can be enabled or disabled independently at any time without affecting existing accounts.
- **Configurable Slicer Preference** ([#313](https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy/issues/313)) — New "Preferred Slicer" setting in General settings to choose between Bambu Studio and OrcaSlicer. Controls the protocol used by all "Open in Slicer" buttons across Archives, 3D Preview, and context menus. OrcaSlicer uses the `orcaslicer://open?file=` protocol. Default remains Bambu Studio for backward compatibility.
- **Local Profiles — OrcaSlicer Import** ([#310](https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy/issues/310)) — Import slicer presets from OrcaSlicer without Bambu Cloud. Supports `.orca_filament`, `.bbscfg`, `.bbsflmt`, `.zip`, and `.json` exports. Resolves OrcaSlicer inheritance chains by fetching base Bambu profiles from GitHub (cached locally with 7-day TTL). Stores presets in the database with extracted core fields (material type, vendor, nozzle temps, pressure advance, compatible printers). New "Local Profiles" tab on the Profiles page with drag-and-drop import, 3-column layout (Filament/Process/Printer), search, and expandable preset details. Local filament presets appear in AMS slot configuration alongside cloud presets. Includes smart profile type detection (explicit type field, ZIP path hints, settings ID keys, content heuristics, and name-based patterns) and material/vendor extraction from preset names as fallback.
- **Hostname Support for Printers** ([#290](https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy/issues/290)) — Printers can now be added using hostnames (e.g., `printer.local`, `my-printer.home.lan`) in addition to IPv4 addresses. Updated backend validation, frontend forms, and all locale labels.
- **Camera View Controls** ([#291](https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy/issues/291)) — Added chamber light toggle and skip objects buttons to both embedded camera viewer and standalone camera page. Extracted skip objects modal into a reusable `SkipObjectsModal` component shared across PrintersPage and both camera views.
- **Per-Filament Spoolman Usage Tracking** ([#277](https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy/pull/277)) — Accurate per-filament usage tracking for Spoolman integration with G-code parsing. Parses 3MF files at print start to build per-layer, per-filament extrusion maps. Reports accurate partial usage when prints fail or are cancelled based on actual layer progress. Tracking data stored in database to survive server restarts. Uses Spoolman's filament density for mm-to-grams conversion. Prefers `tray_uuid` over `tag_uid` for spool identification.
- **Disable AMS Weight Sync Setting** ([#277](https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy/pull/277)) — New toggle to prevent AMS percentage-based weight estimates from overwriting Spoolman's granular usage-based calculations. Includes conditional "Report Partial Usage for Failed Prints" toggle.
- **Home Assistant Environment Variables** ([#283](https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy/issues/283)) — Configure Home Assistant integration via `HA_URL` and `HA_TOKEN` environment variables for zero-configuration add-on deployments. Auto-enables when both variables are set. UI fields become read-only with lock icons when env-managed. Database values preserved as fallback.
- **Spoolman Fill Level for AMS Lite / External Spools** ([#293](https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy/issues/293)) — AMS Lite (no weight sensor) always reported 0% fill level. Now uses Spoolman's remaining weight as a fallback when AMS reports 0%. External spools also show fill level from Spoolman data. Fill bars and hover cards indicate "(Spoolman)" when the data source is Spoolman rather than AMS.
- **Extended Support Bundle Diagnostics** — Support bundle now collects comprehensive diagnostic data for faster issue resolution: printer connectivity and firmware versions, integration status (Spoolman, MQTT, Home Assistant), network interfaces (subnets only), Python package versions, database health checks, Docker environment details, WebSocket connections, and log file info. All data properly anonymized — no IPs, names, or serials included. Privacy disclosure updated on System Info page.

### Improved
- **H2C Nozzle Rack — 6-Slot Display With Empty Placeholders** ([#300](https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy/issues/300)) — The nozzle rack card now always shows 6 rack positions (IDs 16–21), with filled slots showing diameter and empty slots showing placeholder dashes. L/R hotend nozzles (IDs 0, 1) are excluded from the rack card and shown in the dedicated L/R indicator instead.
- **H2 Series — L/R Nozzle Hover Card** ([#300](https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy/issues/300)) — New dual-nozzle hover card shows L and R nozzle details side by side (diameter, type, flow, status, wear, max temp, serial). Active nozzle highlighted in amber with Active/Idle status based on `active_extruder`, replacing the misleading "Docked" label.
- **H2 Series — Single-Nozzle Hover Card** ([#300](https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy/issues/300)) — H2D/H2S printers with a single nozzle now show extended nozzle details (wear, serial, max temp) on hover over the temperature card. Backend changed from H2C-only (>2 nozzles) to all H2 series (any nozzle_info present).
- **H2C Nozzle Rack — Translate Type Codes & Add Flow Info** ([#300](https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy/issues/300)) — Raw nozzle type codes (e.g. "HS", "HH01") are now translated to human-readable names: material (Hardened Steel, Stainless Steel, Tungsten Carbide) and flow type (High Flow, Standard). New "Flow" row in the hover card. Translations added in all 4 locales (en, de, ja, it).
- **H2C Nozzle Rack — Show Filament Material in Hover Card** ([#300](https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy/issues/300)) — Nozzle hover card now shows the loaded filament material type (e.g. "PLA", "PETG") alongside the color swatch, captured from MQTT nozzle info data.
- **H2C Nozzle Rack — Resolve Filament Names From Cloud & Local Profiles** ([#300](https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy/issues/300)) — Nozzle rack hover card previously showed raw filament IDs like "GFU99" instead of human-readable names. Now resolves filament names with a 4-tier fallback: Bambu Cloud preset lookup → local slicer profiles → built-in filament name table (86 known Bambu filament codes) → raw ID fallback. The built-in table resolves names like "Bambu ASA", "Generic TPU", "Generic PLA" when the cloud API returns 400 for certain filament IDs. Also benefits AMS tray tooltips.
- **H2C Nozzle Rack Compact Layout** ([#300](https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy/issues/300)) — Redesigned nozzle rack from a 2×3 grid to a compact single-row layout with bottom accent bars (green = mounted, gray = docked). Temperature cards are thinner, rack card is wider (flex-[2]), and all cards vertically centered.
- **Firmware Version Badge on Printer Card** ([#311](https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy/issues/311)) — Printer cards now show a firmware version badge (when firmware checking is enabled). Green with checkmark when up to date, orange with download icon when an update is available. Clicking the badge opens a firmware info modal showing release notes (auto-expanded when up to date) or the existing update workflow. Badge and modal respect `firmware:read` and `firmware:update` permissions. Translations added in all 4 locales.
- **Auto-Detect Subnet for Printer Discovery** — Docker users no longer need to manually enter a subnet in the Add Printer dialog. Bambuddy auto-detects available network subnets and pre-selects the first one. When multiple subnets are available (e.g., eth0 + wlan0), a dropdown lets users choose. Falls back to manual text input if no subnets are detected.
- **Japanese Locale Complete Overhaul** — Restructured `ja.ts` from a divergent format (different key structure, 12 structural conflicts, 1,366 missing translations) to match the English/German locale structure exactly. Translated all 2,083 keys into Japanese, achieving full parity with EN/DE. Zero structural divergences, zero missing keys.

### Fixed
- **Nozzle Rack Hides 0% Wear** ([#300](https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy/issues/300)) — New nozzles with 0% wear showed no wear info in the hover card because the condition treated 0 the same as "not available." Now displays "Wear: 0%" correctly. The field is still hidden when the printer doesn't report wear data.
- **Nozzle Rack Shows L/R Hotend Nozzles in Rack** ([#300](https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy/issues/300)) — The nozzle rack card incorrectly included L/R hotend nozzles (IDs 0, 1) alongside the 6 rack slots. Now filters to IDs >= 2 (rack only) and always pads to 6 positions with empty placeholders.
- **H2C Firmware Update Downloads Wrong Firmware** ([#311](https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy/issues/311)) — H2C printers were mapped to the H2D firmware API key (`h2d`), causing firmware checks to offer H2D firmware instead of H2C firmware. H2C has its own firmware track (01.01.x.x vs H2D's 01.02.x.x). Added separate `h2c` API key mapping. Also added missing H2C/H2S entries to printer model ID and 3MF model maps.
- **Sidebar Links Custom Icons Have Inverted Colors** ([#308](https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy/issues/308)) — Custom uploaded icons in sidebar links had their colors inverted in dark mode due to a CSS `invert()` filter. The filter was intended for monochrome preset icons but was incorrectly applied to user-uploaded images (e.g., full-color logos). Removed the invert filter from custom icon rendering in the sidebar and the add/edit link modal.
- **Virtual Printer FTP Transfer Fails With Connection Reset** ([#58](https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy/issues/58)) — Large 3MF uploads to the virtual printer intermittently failed with `[Errno 104] Connection reset by peer` while the small verify_job always succeeded. The `_handle_data_connection` callback returned immediately, allowing the asyncio server-handler task to complete while the data connection was still in active use. The passive port listener also stayed open during transfers, risking duplicate data connections. Fixed by keeping the callback alive until the transfer completes (`_transfer_done` event), closing the passive listener after accepting the connection, and rejecting duplicate data connections. Also added a 5-second drain timeout to MQTT status pushes to prevent blocking when the slicer is busy uploading.
- **Virtual Printer IP Override for Server Mode** ([#52](https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy/issues/52)) — The `remote_interface_ip` setting (network interface override) was only used in proxy mode, but users with multiple network interfaces (LAN + Tailscale, Docker bridges) also needed it in server modes (immediate/review/print_queue). Auto-detected IP from `_get_local_ip()` followed the OS default route, causing wrong IP in TLS certificate SAN (handshake failures) and SSDP broadcasts (slicer can't discover printer). Now the interface override applies to all modes: included in certificate SAN, passed to SSDP server as advertise IP, and triggers service restart on change. UI dropdown shown for all modes when enabled (not just proxy).
- **Wrong Thumbnail When Reprinting Same Project** ([#314](https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy/issues/314)) — Reprinting a project with the same name but a different bed layout showed the old thumbnail during printing. The cover image cache was keyed by `subtask_name` and never invalidated between prints, so a cache hit returned the stale first-print thumbnail. Now the cover cache is cleared on every print start.
- **Wrong Timelapse Attached to Archive** ([#315](https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy/issues/315)) — After a print, the archive could receive a timelapse from a previous print instead of the just-completed one. The auto-scan sorted MP4 files by mtime and grabbed the "most recent," but in LAN-only mode (no NTP) the printer's clock is wrong, making mtime unreliable. Replaced with a snapshot-diff approach: baseline existing files before waiting, then detect the new file that appears after encoding. Falls back to print-name matching if no new file is found after retries.
- **Timelapse Not Attached — Baseline Race Condition** ([#315](https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy/issues/315)) — Follow-up to the snapshot-diff timelapse fix: the baseline of existing MP4 files was captured at print completion time inside a background task, but fast-encoding printers could finish writing the timelapse before the baseline was taken, causing the new file to appear in the baseline and never be detected as "new." Moved baseline capture to print start time, when the timelapse file cannot possibly exist yet. Falls back to completion-time baseline if the app was restarted mid-print.
- **Calibration Prints Archived** ([#315](https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy/issues/315)) — Standalone calibration prints (flow, vibration, bed leveling) were being archived as regular prints. The calibration gcode (`/usr/etc/print/auto_cali_for_user.gcode`) and other internal printer files under `/usr/` are now detected and skipped during print start.
- **Camera Stop 401 When Auth Enabled** — Camera stop requests (`sendBeacon`) failed with 401 Unauthorized when authentication was enabled because `sendBeacon` cannot send auth headers. Replaced with `fetch` + `keepalive: true` which supports Authorization headers while remaining reliable during page unload.
- **Spoolman Creates Duplicate Spools on Startup** ([#295](https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy/pull/295)) — Each AMS tray independently fetched all spools from Spoolman, causing redundant API calls and duplicate spool creation with large databases (300+ spools). Now fetches spools once and reuses cached data across all tray operations. Added retry logic (3 attempts, 500ms delay) with connection recreation for transient network errors.
- **Filament Usage Charts Inflated by Quantity Multiplier** ([#229](https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy/issues/229)) — Daily, weekly, and filament-type charts were multiplying `filament_used_grams` by print quantity, even though the value already represents the total for the entire job. A 26-object print using 126g was counted as 3,276g. Removed the erroneous multiplier from three aggregations in `FilamentTrends.tsx`.
- **Energy Cost Shows 0.00 in "Total Consumption" Mode** ([#284](https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy/issues/284)) — Statistics Quick Stats showed 0.00 energy cost when Energy Display Mode was set to "Total Consumption" with Home Assistant smart plugs. The `homeassistant_service` was not configured with HA URL/token before querying plug energy data, causing it to silently return nothing.
- **H2D Pro Prints Fail at ~75% With Extrusion Motor Overload** ([#245](https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy/issues/245)) — H2D Pro firmware interprets `use_ams: 1` (integer) as a nozzle index, routing filament to the deputy nozzle instead of the main nozzle. Bambu Studio sends `use_ams: true` (boolean) while using integers for other fields. Fixed by keeping `use_ams` as boolean for all printers including H2D series.
- **GitHub Backup Description Misleading** — The "App Settings" backup card said "excludes sensitive data" but the complete database is pushed. Updated description to "complete database."
- **Support Bundle Shows 0 AMS Units** — The support info always reported `ams_unit_count: 0` because it expected `raw_data["ams"]` to be a nested dict (`{"ams": [...]}`) but the MQTT handler stores it as a flat list. Now handles both formats.
- **Firmware Badge Shown for Models Without API Data** ([#311](https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy/issues/311)) — Printers whose model has no firmware data in Bambu Lab's API (e.g. H2C on public beta firmware) showed a misleading green "up to date" badge. The badge is now hidden when the API returns no `latest_version`, since there is nothing to compare against.
- **AMS-HT Mapping Fails for Left Nozzle on H2D Pro** ([#318](https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy/issues/318)) — Printing with the left nozzle on dual-nozzle printers (H2D/H2D Pro) using AMS-HT failed with "Failed to get AMS mapping table." The global tray ID for AMS-HT units (ams_id >= 128) was calculated as `ams_id * 4 + tray_id` (= 512), but AMS-HT uses the raw `ams_id` (128) since it has a single tray. The backend then misidentified 512 as an external spool. Fixed in frontend tray ID calculation, backend `ams_mapping2` builder, print scheduler, and Spoolman tracking.
- **H2D Pro L/R Nozzle Hover Card Swapped** ([#300](https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy/issues/300)) — The dual-nozzle hover card had left and right nozzles swapped: nozzle_rack id 0 (extruder 0 = right) was shown as left and vice versa. Serial number and max temp now correctly appear only on the right (removable) nozzle column.
- **H2C Printer Card Shows H2D Image** ([#300](https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy/issues/300)) — The H2C printer card displayed the H2D printer image because no dedicated H2C image existed in the frontend. Added H2C image and updated `getPrinterImage()` to return it for H2C models.
- **H2C Nozzle Rack Shows Wrong Empty Slot and Missing Filament Colors** ([#300](https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy/issues/300)) — Empty rack slots always appeared at position 6 instead of their actual position because nozzles were mapped by array index instead of by ID. Fixed by mapping each nozzle to its correct rack position (`id - 16`). Filament colors and materials were missing because the H2C uses different MQTT field names (`color_m`, `fila_id`, `sn`, `tm`) than the H2D (`filament_colour`, `filament_id`, `serial_number`, `max_temp`). Added fallback field name resolution. Also fixed nozzle rack layout breaking on medium card size by allowing the temperature row to wrap.

- **Firewall Rules Updated** — Added port 50000-50100/tcp to all UFW, firewalld, and iptables examples for proxy mode FTP passive data.

### Testing
- **Mock FTPS Server & Comprehensive FTP Test Suite** — Added 67 automated test cases against a real implicit FTPS mock server, covering every known FTP failure mode from 0.1.8+:
  - Mock server (`mock_ftp_server.py`) implements implicit TLS, custom AVBL command, and per-command failure injection
  - Connection tests: auth, SSL modes (prot_p/prot_c), timeout, cache, disconnect edge cases
  - Upload tests: chunked transfer via `transfercmd()`, progress callbacks, 553/550/552 error handling
  - Download tests: bytes, to-file, 0-byte regression, large files, missing file cleanup
  - Model-specific tests: X1C session reuse, A1/A1 Mini prot_c fallback, P1S, unknown model defaults
  - Async wrapper tests: upload/download/list/delete with A1 fallback and multi-path download
  - Failure injection tests: regressions for `error_perm` hierarchy, `diagnose_storage` CWD propagation, injection count decrement
  - Added `pyOpenSSL` to `requirements-dev.txt` for Docker test image compatibility
- **Nozzle Rack Tests** — Backend: 7 tests for MQTT nozzle_info parsing (H2C 8-entry, H2D 2-entry, H2S single, empty, sorting, field mapping, nozzle state updates). Frontend: 3 tests for rack card rendering (H2C shows 6 slots, empty placeholders, hidden when no rack IDs).

## [0.1.8.1] - 2026-02-07

### Fixed
- **FTP Upload Broken on All Printer Models** — Fixed critical bug where all FTP uploads failed with "550 Failed to change directory":
  - `diagnose_storage()` was running before every upload, and its CWD failures (`ftplib.error_perm`) were not caught because `error_perm` is not a subclass of `error_reply`
  - Removed `diagnose_storage()` from the upload hot path
  - Changed all FTP exception handlers from `except (OSError, ftplib.error_reply)` to `except (OSError, ftplib.Error)` to catch all FTP error types
- **HTTP 500 on Reprint and Print Endpoints** — Fixed 500 errors on `/api/v1/archives/{id}/reprint` and `/api/v1/library/files/{id}/print` caused by the FTP failure above
- **Exception Handling Reverted** — Reverted overly-narrow exception handling introduced in 0.1.8 that could cause uncaught errors in archive parsing, HTTP clients, 3MF/ZIP processing, Home Assistant, and firmware checks
- **HTTP 500 on Printer Cover Image** — Fixed 500 error on `/api/v1/printers/{id}/cover` when FTP download returned 0 bytes but reported success; now retries and falls back to 404
- **4-Segment Version Support** — Version parser now supports patch releases like `0.1.8.1` for hotfixes without incrementing the minor version

## [0.1.8] - 2026-02-06

### Security
- **XML External Entity (XXE) Prevention**:
  - Replaced `xml.etree.ElementTree` with `defusedxml` across all 3MF parsing code
  - Prevents XXE attacks through malicious 3MF files
  - Detected by Bandit B314 security scanner
- **Path Injection Vulnerabilities Fixed**:
  - Added path traversal validation to project attachment endpoints
  - Strengthened filename sanitization in timelapse processing
  - Prevents directory traversal attacks via `../` sequences
  - Detected by CodeQL security scanner
- **Security Scanning in CI/CD**:
  - Added Bandit (Python security analyzer) with SARIF upload to GitHub Security

  - Added pip-audit and npm-audit for dependency vulnerability scanning
  - Automatic GitHub issue creation for detected vulnerabilities
  - Security scan results visible in GitHub Security tab
- **CodeQL Zero-Finding Baseline**:
  - Reduced CodeQL findings from 591 to 0 across Python, JavaScript, and GitHub Actions
  - Created custom query suites (`.codeql/python-bambuddy.qls`, `.codeql/javascript-bambuddy.qls`) with documented accepted-risk exclusions
  - All exclusions reviewed and justified (log injection parameterized, cyclic imports from SQLAlchemy ORM, intentional 0.0.0.0 binds, etc.)
- **Log Injection Prevention**:
  - Converted ~700 f-string log calls to parameterized `%s` style across all backend files
  - Prevents log injection via newlines or fake log entries in user-controlled data
- **Exception Handling Hardened**:
  - Narrowed ~265 bare `except Exception` blocks to specific types (`OSError`, `KeyError`, `ValueError`, `zipfile.BadZipFile`, `sqlalchemy.exc.OperationalError`, etc.)
- **Stack Trace Exposure Fixed**:
  - Replaced `str(e)` with generic error messages in HTTP responses (`updates.py`)
  - Detailed errors still logged server-side for debugging
- **SSRF Mitigations Added**:
  - Home Assistant integration: URL scheme/hostname validation, metadata-service blocking (`homeassistant.py`)
  - Tasmota integration: IP validation blocking loopback and link-local addresses (`tasmota.py`)
- **Hashlib Security Annotations**:
  - Added `usedforsecurity=False` to non-security hash calls (MD5 for AMS fingerprinting, SHA1 for git blob format)
- **Unused Code Removal**:
  - Removed ~30 redundant function-level imports, unused variables, dead code, and trivial conditions flagged by CodeQL
- **Local Security Scanner Improvements**:
  - `test_security.sh` uses `--threads=0` for all CodeQL commands (auto-detects CPU cores)
  - Added `.trivyignore` to suppress accepted Dockerfile USER directive finding

### Enhancements
- **Per-Filament Spoolman Usage Tracking** (PR #277):
  - Reports exact filament consumption per spool to Spoolman after each print
  - Parses G-code from 3MF files for layer-by-layer extrusion data (multi-material support)
  - New setting: "Disable AMS Estimated Weight Sync" to prefer Spoolman usage tracking over AMS weight estimates
  - New setting: "Report Partial Usage for Failed Prints" estimates filament used up to the failure point based on layer progress
  - Persists tracking data in SQLite for reliability across restarts
  - Extracted Spoolman tracking into dedicated service module with DRY helpers
- **3D Model Viewer Improvements** (PR #262):
  - Added plate selector for multi-plate 3MF files with thumbnail previews
  - Object count display shows number of objects per plate and total
  - Fullscreen toggle for immersive model viewing
  - Resizable split view between plate selector and 3D viewer in fullscreen mode
  - Pagination support for files with many plates (e.g., 50+ plates)
  - Added i18n translations for all model viewer strings (English, German, Japanese)
- **Virtual Printer Proxy Mode Improvements**:
  - SSDP proxy for cross-network setups: select slicer network interface for automatic printer discovery via SSDP relay
  - FTP proxy now listens on privileged port 990 (matching Bambu Studio expectations) instead of 9990
  - For systemd: requires `AmbientCapabilities=CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE` capability
  - Automatic directory permission checking at startup with clear error messages for Docker/bare metal
  - Updated translations for proxy mode steps in English, German, and Japanese

### Fixed
- **Authentication Required Error After Initial Setup** (Issue #257):
  - Fixed "Authentication required" error when using printer controls after fresh install with auth enabled
  - Token clearing on 401 responses is now more selective - only clears on invalid token messages
  - Generic "Authentication required" errors (which may be timing issues) no longer clear the token
  - Also fixed smart plug discovery scan endpoints missing auth headers
- **Filament Hover Card Overlapping Navigation Bar** (Issue #259):
  - Fixed filament info popup being partially covered by the navigation bar
  - Hover card positioning now accounts for the fixed 56px header
  - Cards near the top of the page now correctly flip to show below the slot
- **Filament Statistics Incorrectly Multiplied by Quantity** (Issue #229):
  - Fixed filament totals being inflated by incorrectly multiplying by quantity
  - The `filament_used_grams` field already contains the total for the entire print job
  - Removed incorrect `* quantity` multiplication from archive stats, Prometheus metrics, and FilamentTrends chart
  - Example: A print with 26 objects using 126g was incorrectly shown as 3,276g
- **Print Queue Status Does Not Match Printer Status** (Issue #249):
  - Queue now shows "Paused" when the printer is paused instead of "Printing"
  - Fetches real-time printer state for actively printing queue items
  - Added translations for paused status in English, German, and Japanese
- **Queue Scheduled Time Displayed in Wrong Timezone** (Issue #233):
  - Fixed scheduled time being displayed in UTC instead of local timezone when editing queue items

- **Mobile Layout Issues on Archives and Statistics Pages** (Issue #255):
  - Fixed header buttons overflowing outside the screen on iPhone/mobile devices
  - Headers now stack vertically on small screens with proper wrapping
  - Applied consistent responsive pattern from PrintersPage
- **AMS Auto-Matching Selects Wrong Slot** (Issue #245):
  - Fixed AMS slot mapping when multiple trays have the same `tray_info_idx` (filament type identifier)
  - `tray_info_idx` (e.g., "GFA00" for generic PLA) identifies filament TYPE, not unique spools
  - When multiple trays match the same type, color is now used as a tiebreaker
  - Previously used `find()` which always returned the first match regardless of color
  - Fixed in both backend (print_scheduler.py) and frontend (useFilamentMapping.ts)
  - Resolves wrong tray selection (e.g., A4 instead of B1) when multiple AMS units have same filament type
- **A1/A1 Mini FTP Upload Failures** (Issue #271):
  - Fixed FTP uploads hanging/timing out on A1 and A1 Mini printers
  - Replaced `storbinary()` with manual chunked transfer using `transfercmd()`
  - A1's FTP server has issues with Python's `storbinary()` waiting for completion response
  - Uses 1MB chunks with explicit 120s socket timeout for reliable transfers
  - Works for all printer models (X1C, P1S, P1P, A1, A1 Mini)
- **P1S/P1P FTP Upload Failures**:
  - Fixed FTP uploads failing with EOFError on P1S and P1P printers
  - These printers use vsFTPd which requires SSL session reuse on data channel
  - Removed P1S/P1P from skip-session-reuse list (they were incorrectly added)
- **FTP Auto-Detection for A1 Printers**:
  - Automatically detects working FTP mode (prot_p vs prot_c) for A1/A1 Mini
  - Tries encrypted data channel first, falls back to clear if needed
  - Caches working mode per printer IP to avoid repeated detection
- **Safari Camera Stream Failing**:
  - Fixed camera streams not loading in Safari due to Service Worker error
  - Safari has stricter Service Worker scope requirements
- **Queue Print Time for Multi-Plate Files** (PR #274):
  - Fixed print time showing total for all plates instead of selected plate
  - Now extracts per-plate print time from 3MF slice_info.config
  - Contributed by MisterBeardy
- **Docker Permissions**:
  - Added user directive to docker-compose.yml using PUID/PGID environment variables
  - Allows container to run as host user, fixing permission issues with bind-mounted volumes
  - Usage: `PUID=$(id -u) PGID=$(id -g) docker compose up -d`

### Added
- **Windows Portable Launcher** (contributed by nmori):
  - New `start_bambuddy.bat` for Windows users - double-click to run, no installation required
  - Automatically downloads Python 3.13 and Node.js 22 on first run (portable, no system changes)
  - Everything stored in `.portable\` folder for easy cleanup
  - Commands: `start_bambuddy.bat` (launch), `start_bambuddy.bat update` (update deps), `start_bambuddy.bat reset` (clean start)
  - Custom port via `set PORT=9000 & start_bambuddy.bat`
  - Verifies all downloads with SHA256 checksums for security
  - Supports both x64 and ARM64 Windows systems

## [0.1.7] - 2026-02-03

### Security
- **Critical: Missing API Endpoint Authentication** (CVE-2026-25505, CVSS 9.8):
  - Added authentication to 200+ API endpoints that were previously unprotected
  - All route files now use `RequirePermissionIfAuthEnabled()` for permission checks
  - Protected endpoints: archives, projects, settings, API keys, groups, cloud, notifications, maintenance, filaments, external links, smart plugs, discovery, firmware, camera, k-profiles, AMS history, pending uploads, updates, spoolman, system, print queue, printers
  - Image-serving endpoints (thumbnails, timelapse, photos, camera streams) remain public as they require knowing the resource ID and are loaded via `<img>` tags which cannot send Authorization headers
  - Backend integration tests added to verify endpoint authentication enforcement

### Enhancements
- **TOTP Authenticator Support for Bambu Cloud** (Issue #182):
  - Added support for TOTP-based two-factor authentication when connecting to Bambu Cloud
  - Accounts with authenticator apps (Google Authenticator, Authy, etc.) now work correctly
  - Proper detection of verification type: email code vs TOTP code
  - Uses browser-like headers to bypass Cloudflare protection on TFA endpoint
  - Frontend shows appropriate message for each verification type
  - Added translations for TOTP UI in English, German, and Japanese
- **Spoolman: Open in Spoolman Button** (Issue #210):
  - FilamentHoverCard now shows "Open in Spoolman" button when spool is already linked in Spoolman
  - Button links directly to the spool's page in Spoolman for quick editing
  - "Link to Spoolman" button now only shows when spool is not yet linked
  - Link button correctly disabled when no unlinked spools are available in Spoolman
  - Toast notification shown on successful/failed spool linking
  - Added `/api/v1/spoolman/spools/linked` endpoint returning map of linked spool tags to IDs
- **Complete German Translations**:
  - All UI strings now fully translated to German (1800+ translation keys)
  - Pages translated: Settings, Archives, File Manager, Queue, Printers, Profiles, Projects, Stats, Maintenance, Camera, Groups, Users, Login, Setup, Stream Overlay
  - Components translated: ConfirmModal, LinkSpoolModal, FilamentHoverCard, Layout
  - Added locale parity test to ensure English and German stay in sync
- **Virtual Printer Proxy Mode**:
  - New "Proxy" mode allows remote printing over any network by relaying slicer traffic to a real printer
  - Configure a target printer and Bambuddy acts as a TLS proxy between your slicer and the printer
  - Supports both FTP (port 9990) and MQTT (port 8883) protocols with full TLS encryption
  - Slicer connects to Bambuddy using the real printer's access code
  - Real-time status display showing active FTP/MQTT connections
  - Target printer selector with validation (must be configured in Bambuddy)
  - Proxy mode bypasses the access code requirement (uses the real printer's credentials)
  - Full i18n support for all proxy mode UI strings (English, German, Japanese)

### Fixed
- **Cannot Link Multiple HA Entities to Same Printer** (Issue #214):
  - Fixed Home Assistant entities being limited to one per printer
  - Both frontend and backend were blocking printers that already had any smart plug linked
  - Now only Tasmota plugs are limited to one per printer (physical device constraint)
  - Multiple HA entities (switches, scripts, lights, etc.) can be linked to the same printer
  - Restored "Show on Printer Card" toggle for HA entities to control visibility on printer cards
  - Fixed printer card only showing `script.*` entities; now shows all HA entities with toggle enabled
  - HA entities now default to auto_on=False and auto_off=False (appropriate for automations)
  - Printer cards now update immediately when HA entities are added/modified/deleted
- **Monthly Comparison Calculation Off** (Issue #229):
  - Fixed filament statistics not accounting for quantity multiplier
  - Monthly comparison chart now correctly multiplies `filament_used_grams` by `quantity`
  - Daily and weekly charts also now account for quantity
  - Filament type breakdown includes quantity in calculations
  - Backend stats endpoint (`/archives/stats`) and Prometheus metrics also fixed
  - Prints count now shows total items (sum of quantities) instead of archive count
- **Authentication Required for Downloads** (Issue #231):
  - Fixed support bundle download returning 401 Unauthorized when auth is enabled
  - Fixed archive export (CSV/XLSX) failing with authentication enabled
  - Fixed statistics export failing with authentication enabled
  - Fixed printer file ZIP download failing with authentication enabled
  - Root cause: These endpoints used raw `fetch()` without Authorization header
- **Queue Schedule Date Picker Ignores User Format Settings** (Issue #233):
  - Replaced native datetime picker with custom date/time inputs respecting user settings
  - Date input shows in user's format (DD/MM/YYYY for EU, MM/DD/YYYY for US, YYYY-MM-DD for ISO)
  - Time input shows in user's format (24H or 12H with AM/PM)
  - Calendar button opens native picker for convenience; selection is formatted to user's preference
  - Placeholder text shows expected format (e.g., "DD/MM/YYYY" or "HH:MM AM/PM")
  - Added date utilities: `formatDateInput`, `parseDateInput`, `getDatePlaceholder`
  - Added time utilities: `formatTimeInput`, `parseTimeInput`, `getTimePlaceholder`
- **500 Error on Archive Detail Page**:
  - Fixed internal server error when viewing individual archive details
  - Root cause: `project` relationship not eagerly loaded in `get_archive()` service method
  - Async SQLAlchemy requires explicit eager loading; lazy loading is not supported

## [0.1.6.2] - 2026-02-02

> **Security Release**: This release addresses critical security vulnerabilities. Users running authentication-enabled instances should upgrade immediately.

### Security
- **Critical: Hardcoded JWT Secret Key** (GHSA-gc24-px2r-5qmf, CWE-321) - Fixed hardcoded JWT secret key that could allow attackers to forge authentication tokens:
  - JWT secret now loaded from `JWT_SECRET_KEY` environment variable (recommended for production)
  - Falls back to auto-generated `.jwt_secret` file in data directory with secure permissions (0600)
  - Generates cryptographically secure 64-byte random secret if neither exists
  - **Action Required**: Existing users will need to re-login after upgrading
- **Critical: Missing API Authentication** (GHSA-gc24-px2r-5qmf, CWE-306) - Fixed 77+ API endpoints that lacked authentication checks:
  - Added HTTP middleware enforcing authentication on ALL `/api/` routes when auth is enabled
  - Only essential public endpoints are exempt (login, auth status, version check, WebSocket)
  - All other API calls now require valid JWT token or API key

### Enhancements
- **Location Filter for Queue** (Issue #220):
  - Filter queue jobs by printer location in the Queue page
  - "Any {Model}" queue assignments can now specify a target location (e.g., "Any X1C in Workshop")
  - Location filter dropdown shows all unique locations from printers and queue items
  - Location is saved with queue items and displayed in the queue list
- **Ownership-Based Permissions** (Issue #205):
  - Users can now only update/delete their own items unless they have elevated permissions
  - Update/delete permissions split into `*_own` and `*_all` variants:
    - `queue:update_own` / `queue:update_all`
    - `queue:delete_own` / `queue:delete_all`
    - `archives:update_own` / `archives:update_all`
    - `archives:delete_own` / `archives:delete_all`
    - `archives:reprint_own` / `archives:reprint_all`
    - `library:update_own` / `library:update_all`
    - `library:delete_own` / `library:delete_all`
  - Administrators group gets `*_all` permissions (can modify any items)
  - Operators group gets `*_own` permissions (can only modify their own items)
  - Ownerless items (legacy data without creator) require `*_all` permission
  - Bulk operations skip items user doesn't have permission to modify
  - User deletion now offers choice: delete user's items or keep them (become ownerless)
  - Backend enforces permissions on all API endpoints (not just frontend UI)
  - Automatic migration upgrades existing groups to new permission model
- **User Tracking for Archives, Library & Queue** (Issue #206):
  - Track and display who uploaded each archive file
  - Track and display who uploaded each library file (File Manager)
  - Track and display who added each print job to the queue
  - Shows username on archive cards, library files, queue items, and printer cards (while printing)
  - Works when authentication is enabled; gracefully hidden when auth is disabled
  - Database migration adds `created_by_id` columns to `print_archives`, `library_files`, and `print_queue` tables
- **Separate AMS RFID Permission** (Issue #204):
  - Added new `printers:ams_rfid` permission for re-reading AMS RFID tags
  - Allows granting RFID re-read access without full printer control permissions
  - Operators group includes this permission by default
  - Available in Settings > Users > Group Editor as a toggleable permission
- **Schedule Button on Archive Cards** (Issue #208):
  - Added "Schedule" button next to "Reprint" on archive cards for quick access to print scheduling
  - Previously only available in the context menu (right-click)
  - Respects `queue:create` permission for users with restricted access
- **Streaming Overlay Improvements** (Issue #164):
  - **Configurable FPS**: Add `?fps=30` parameter to control camera frame rate (1-30, default 15)
  - **Status-only mode**: Add `?camera=false` parameter to hide camera and show only status overlay on black background
  - Increased default camera FPS from 10 to 15 for smoother video across all camera views
- **Simplified Backup/Restore System**:
  - Complete backup now creates a single ZIP file containing the entire database and all data directories
  - Includes: database, archives, library files, thumbnails, timelapses, icons, projects, and plate calibration data
  - Portable backups: works across different installations and data directories
  - Faster backup/restore: direct file copy instead of JSON export/import
  - Progress indicator and navigation blocking during backup/restore operations
  - Removed ~2000 lines of legacy JSON-based backup/restore code

### Fixes

  - Added `library:read` permission check to all list/view endpoints (files, folders, stats)
  - Added `library:upload` permission check to upload and folder creation endpoints
  - Added `queue:create` permission check to add-to-queue endpoint
  - Added `printers:control` permission check to direct print endpoint
  - Added ownership-based permission checks to file move operation
  - Users without `library:read` permission can no longer view files in the File Manager
  - Users can now only delete/update their own files unless they have `*_all` permissions
- **JWT secret key not persistent across restarts** - Fixed JWT secret key generation to properly use data directory, ensuring tokens remain valid across container restarts
- **Images/thumbnails returning 401 when auth enabled** - Fixed auth middleware to allow public access to image/media endpoints (thumbnails, photos, QR codes, timelapses, camera streams) since browser elements like `<img>` don't send Authorization headers
- **Library thumbnails missing after restore** - Fixed library files using absolute paths that break after restore on different systems:
  - Library now stores relative paths in database for portability
  - Automatic migration converts existing absolute paths to relative on startup
  - Thumbnails and files now display correctly after restoring backups
- **File uploads failing with authentication enabled** - Fixed all file upload functions (archives, photos, timelapses, library files, etc.) not sending authentication headers when auth is enabled
- **External spool AMS mapping causing "Failed to get AMS mapping table"** (Issue #213) - Fixed external spool `ams_mapping2` slot_id handling that caused AMS mapping failures
- **Filename matching for files with spaces** (Issue #218) - Fixed file detection when filenames contain spaces
- **P2S FTP upload failure** (Issue #218) - Fixed FTP uploads to P2S printers by passing `skip_session_reuse` to ImplicitFTP_TLS
- **Printer deletion freeze** (Issue #214) - Fixed UI freeze when deleting printers, and now allows multiple smart plugs per printer
- **Stack trace exposure in error responses** (CodeQL Alert #68) - Fixed stack traces being exposed in API error responses in archives.py

- **GitHub Backup Timestamps** - Removed volatile timestamps from GitHub backup files so git diffs only show actual data changes
- **Model-Based Queue AMS Mapping** - Fixed "Any [Model]" queue jobs failing at filament loading on H2D Pro and other printers (Issue #192):
  - Scheduler now computes AMS mapping after printer assignment for model-based jobs
  - Previously, no AMS mapping was sent because the specific printer wasn't known at queue time
  - Auto-matches required filaments to available AMS slots by type and color
