# Changelog

All notable changes to Bambuddy will be documented in this file.

## [0.1.6b11] - 2026-01-22

### New Features
- **Camera Zoom & Fullscreen** - Enhanced camera viewer controls:
  - Fullscreen mode for embedded camera viewer (new button in header)
  - Zoom controls (100%-400%) for both embedded and window modes
  - Pan support when zoomed in (click and drag)
  - Mouse wheel zoom support
  - Zoom resets on mode switch, refresh, or fullscreen toggle
- **Searchable HA Entity Selection** - Improved Home Assistant smart plug configuration:
  - Entity dropdown replaced with searchable combobox
  - Type to search across all HA entities (not just switch/light/input_boolean)
  - Energy sensor dropdowns (Power, Energy Today, Total) are now searchable
  - Find sensors with non-standard naming that don't match the switch entity name
- **Home Assistant Energy Sensor Support** - HA smart plugs can now use separate sensor entities for energy monitoring:
  - Configure dedicated power sensor (W), today's energy (kWh), and total energy (kWh) sensors
  - Supports plugs where energy data is exposed as separate sensor entities (common with Tapo, IKEA Zigbee2mqtt, etc.)
  - Energy sensors are selectable from all available HA sensors with power/energy units
  - Falls back to switch entity attributes if no sensors configured
  - Print energy tracking now works correctly for HA plugs (not just Tasmota)
  - New API endpoint: `GET /api/v1/smart-plugs/ha/sensors` to list available energy sensors
- **Finish Photo in Notifications** - Camera snapshot URL available in notification templates (Issue #126):
  - New `{finish_photo_url}` template variable for print_complete, print_failed, print_stopped events
  - Photo is captured before notification is sent (ensures image is available)
  - New "External URL" setting in Settings → Network (auto-detects from browser)
  - Full URL constructed for external notification services (Telegram, Email, Discord, etc.)
- **ZIP File Support in File Manager** - Upload and extract ZIP files directly in the library (Issue #121):
  - Drop or select ZIP files to automatically extract contents
  - Option to preserve folder structure from ZIP or extract flat
  - Extracts thumbnails and metadata from 3MF/gcode files inside ZIP
  - Progress indicator shows number of files extracted

### Fixed
- **Print time stats using slicer estimates** - Quick Stats "Print Time" now uses actual elapsed time (`completed_at - started_at`) instead of slicer estimates; cancelled prints only count time actually printed (Issue #137)
- **Skip objects modal overflow** - Modal now has max height (85vh) with scrollable object list when printing many items on the bed (Issue #134)
- **Filament cost using wrong default** - Statistics now correctly uses the "Default filament cost (per kg)" setting instead of hardcoded €25 value (Issue #120)
- **Spoolman tag field not auto-created** - The required "tag" extra field is now automatically created in Spoolman on first connect, fixing sync failures for fresh Spoolman installs (Issue #123)
- **P2S/X1E/H2 completion photo not captured** - Internal model codes (N7, C13, O1D, etc.) from MQTT/SSDP are now recognized for RTSP camera support (Issue #127)
- **Mattermost/Slack webhook 400 error** - Added "Slack / Mattermost" payload format option that sends `{"text": "..."}` instead of custom fields (Issue #133)
- **Subnet scan serial number** - Fixed A1 Mini subnet discovery showing "unknown-*" placeholder; serial field is now cleared so users know to enter it manually (Issue #140)

## [0.1.6b10] - 2026-01-21

### New Features
- **Unified Print Modal** - Consolidated three separate modals into one unified component:
  - Single modal handles reprint, add-to-queue, and edit-queue-item operations
  - Consistent UI/UX across all print operations
  - Reduced code duplication (~1300 LOC removed)

  - Progress indicator during multi-printer submission
  - Ideal for print farms with identical filament configurations
- **Per-Printer AMS Mapping** - Configure filament slot mapping individually for each printer:

  - Auto-configure uses RFID data to match filaments automatically
  - Manual override for specific slot assignments
  - Match status indicator shows exact/partial/missing matches
  - Re-read button to refresh printer's loaded filaments
  - New setting in Settings → Filament to expand custom mapping by default
- **Enhanced Add-to-Queue** - Now includes plate selection and print options:
  - Configure all print settings upfront instead of editing afterward
  - Filament mapping with manual override capability

  - "Print" button appears when exactly one sliced file is selected
  - Opens full PrintModal with plate selection and print options
  - "Add to Queue" button now uses Clock icon for clarity
- **Multiple Embedded Camera Viewers** - Open camera streams for multiple printers simultaneously in embedded mode:
  - Each viewer has its own remembered position and size
  - New viewers are automatically offset to prevent stacking
  - Printer-specific persistence in localStorage
  - **Navigation persistence** - Open cameras stay open when navigating away and back to Printers page
- **Application Log Viewer** - View and filter application logs in real-time from System Information page:
  - Start/Stop live streaming with 2-second auto-refresh

  - Text search across messages and logger names
  - Clear logs with one click
  - Expandable multi-line log entries (stack traces, etc.)

  - Queue items store `library_file_id` directly
  - Archives are created automatically when prints start
  - Reduces clutter in Archives from unprinted queued files
  - Queue displays library file name, thumbnail, and print time
- **Expandable Color Picker** - Configure AMS Slot modal now has an expandable color palette:

  - Validates filenames (no path separators allowed)
- **File Manager Mobile Accessibility** - Improved touch device support:
  - Three-dot menu button always visible on mobile (hover-only on desktop)

  - Better PWA experience for file management
- **Optional Authentication** - Secure your Bambuddy instance with user authentication:
  - Enable/disable authentication via Setup page or Settings → Users
  - Role-based access control: Admin and User roles
  - Admins have full access; Users can manage prints but not settings
  - JWT-based authentication with 7-day token expiration
  - User management page for creating, editing, and deleting users
  - Backward compatible: existing installations work without authentication
  - Settings page restricted to admin users when auth is enabled

### Changed
- **Edit Queue Item modal** - Single printer selection only (reassigns item, doesn't duplicate)
- **Edit Queue Item button** - Changed from "Print to X Printers" to "Save"

### Fixed
- **File Manager folder navigation** - Fixed bug where opening a folder would briefly show files then jump back to root:
  - Removed `selectedFolderId` from useEffect dependency array that was causing a reset loop
  - Folder navigation now works correctly without resetting
- **Queue items with library files** - Fixed 500 errors when listing/updating queue items from File Manager
- **User preset AMS configuration** - Fixed user presets (inheriting from Bambu presets) showing empty fields in Bambu Studio after configuration:
  - Now correctly derives `tray_info_idx` from the preset's `base_id` when `filament_id` is null
  - User presets that inherit from Bambu presets (e.g., "# Overture Matte PLA @BBL H2D") now work correctly
- **Faster AMS slot updates** - Frontend now updates immediately after configuring AMS slots:
  - Added WebSocket broadcast to AMS change callback for instant UI updates
  - Removed unnecessary delayed refetch that was causing slow updates

  - Click badge to download, or use "Download F3D" in context menu
  - F3D files included in backup/restore
  - API tests for F3D endpoints

### Fixed
- **Multi-plate 3MF metadata extraction** - Single-plate exports from multi-plate projects now show correct thumbnail and name:
  - Extracts plate index from slice_info.config metadata
  - Uses correct plate thumbnail (e.g., plate_5.png instead of plate_1.png)
  - Appends "Plate N" to print name for plates > 1
  - Closes [#92](https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy/issues/92)
