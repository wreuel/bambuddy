### Fixed
- **Camera stream reconnection** - Improved detection of stuck camera streams with automatic reconnection:
  - Periodic stall detection checks every 5 seconds
  - Automatic reconnection when stream stops receiving frames
  - New `/api/v1/printers/{id}/camera/status` endpoint for stream health monitoring
- **Spoolman sync** - Fixed sync issues with Spoolman integration:
  - Now only matches Bambu Lab vendor filaments when syncing
  - Prevents incorrect matching with third-party filaments by color alone
  - Improved filament matching accuracy
- **Archive card context menu** - Fixed context menu positioning issues (#46)
- **Printer card cover image** - Fixed wrong cover image displayed for multi-plate print files
- **Skip objects modal** - Fixed object ID markers not correctly positioned over build plate preview:
  - Now uses `bbox_all` from plate metadata for accurate coordinate mapping
  - Markers correctly position relative to the actual object bounds in the preview image
  - Works correctly for multi-plate projects
- **Active AMS slot display (H2D)** - Fixed incorrect slot display on H2D printers with multiple AMS units:
  - Now parses `snow` field from `device.extruder.info` which contains actual AMS ID
  - Previously picked first AMS on the extruder, causing wrong display when multiple AMS connected
  - Example: Switching from B2 to C1 now correctly shows C1 instead of A1

- **GCode viewer** - Minor improvements to GCode visualization
- **Cover image retrieval** - Improved reliability of cover image extraction
- **Virtual printer SSDP model codes** - Corrected model codes for slicer compatibility:
  - C11=P1P, C12=P1S (were incorrectly swapped)
  - N7=P2S (was incorrectly using C13 which is X1E)
  - 3DPrinter-X1-Carbon for X1C (full model name format)
- **Virtual printer serial prefixes** - Fixed serial number prefixes to match real printers:
  - Based on actual Bambu Lab serial number format (MMM??RYMDDUUUUU)
  - X1C=00M, P1S=01P, P1P=01S, P2S=22E, A1=039, A1M=030, H2D=094, X1E=03W
- **Virtual printer startup model** - Fixed model not loading from database on container restart:
  - Virtual printer now correctly restores the saved model on startup
  - Previously always started with default X1C model regardless of saved setting
- **Virtual printer model change** - Fixed model changes not taking effect while running:
  - Model changes now automatically restart the virtual printer
  - Removed frontend restriction that required manual disable/enable
- **Docker certificate persistence** - Fixed virtual printer certificate storage:
  - Removed unused `bambuddy_vprinter` volume (was mounting to wrong path)
  - Certificates now correctly persist in `bambuddy_data` volume
  - Added optional bind mount for sharing certs between Docker and native installations

### Changed
- **Virtual printer setup documentation** - Improved setup instructions:
  - Prominent "Setup Required" warning in UI linking to documentation
  - Certificate must **replace** the last cert in slicer's printer.cer file (not append!)
  - Clear guidance: one CA only per slicer, replace when switching hosts
  - Platform-specific instructions for Linux, Docker, macOS, Windows, Unraid, Synology, TrueNAS, Proxmox
  - Added troubleshooting for TLS connection errors

### Tests

  - Secure TLS/MQTT communication with auto-generated certificates
  - Queue mode (prints go to pending uploads) or auto-start mode
  - Configurable access code for authentication
  - Works with Docker (requires `network_mode: host`)
  - Persistent certificates across container rebuilds via volume mount

### Fixed
- **Backup/restore for virtual printer settings** - Virtual printer settings (enabled, access code, mode) now correctly persist after restore without being overwritten by auto-save

## [0.1.6b] - 2025-12-28

### Added

- **Timelapse editor** - Edit timelapse videos with trim, speed adjustment (0.25x-4x), and music overlay. Uses FFmpeg for server-side processing with browser-based preview.
- **AMS filament preview** - Reprint modal shows filament comparison between what the print requires and what's currently loaded in the AMS. Compares both type and color with visual indicators (green=match, yellow=color mismatch, orange=type mismatch). Includes Re-read button to refresh AMS status from printer, fuzzy color matching for similar colors, and shows AMS slot location for each matched filament.
- **File type badge** - Archive cards now show GCODE (green) or SOURCE (orange) badge to indicate whether the file is a sliced print-ready file or source-only.
- **Docker printer discovery** - Subnet scanning for discovering printers when running in Docker with `network_mode: host`. Automatically detects Docker environment and shows subnet input field in Add Printer dialog.
- **Printer model mapping** - Discovery now shows friendly model names (X1C, H2D, P1S) instead of raw SSDP codes (BL-P001, O1D, C11).
- **Discovery API tests** - Comprehensive test coverage for discovery endpoints.
- **Project filament colors** - Project cards now display filament color swatches from assigned archives.
- **BOM filter** - Hide completed BOM items with "Hide done" toggle on project detail page.

- **Project page layout** - Improved spacing and padding on project list and detail pages.
- **Delete confirmations** - Replaced browser confirm dialogs with styled confirmation modals.

### Fixed
- **Notification module** - Fixed bug where notifications were sent even when printer was offline.
- **Attachment uploads** - Fixed file attachments not persisting due to SQLAlchemy JSON column mutation detection.
- **Camera stream stability** - Fixed stream stopping after a few minutes by increasing ffmpeg read timeout (10s→30s), adding buffer options, and implementing auto-reconnection with exponential backoff in the frontend.

## [0.1.5] - 2025-12-19

### Fixed
- **Browser freeze on print completion** - Fixed freeze when camera stream was open during print completion by using buffered camera frames instead of spawning duplicate ffmpeg processes
- **Printer status "timelapse" effect** - Fixed issue where navigating to printer page after print showed metrics animating slowly from mid-print values to final state; printer_status messages now bypass the throttled queue
- **Timelapse auto-download** - Complete rewrite with retry mechanism and multiple path support
- **Timelapse detection for H2D** - H2D sends timelapse status in ipcam.timelapse field, not xcam.timelapse
- **Reprint from archive** - Fixed bug where print button sent slicer source file instead of sliced gcode
