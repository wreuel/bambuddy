# Changelog

All notable changes to Bambuddy will be documented in this file.


## [0.1.8] - Not released

### Security
- **XML External Entity (XXE) Prevention**:
  - Replaced `xml.etree.ElementTree` with `defusedxml` across all 3MF parsing code
  - Prevents XXE attacks through malicious 3MF files
  - Detected by Bandit B314 security scanner
- **Path Injection Vulnerabilities Fixed**:
  - Added path traversal validation to project attachment endpoints
  - Strengthened filename sanitization in timelapse processing
  - Prevents directory traversal attacks via `../` sequences
  - Detected by CodeQL security scanner
- **Security Scanning in CI/CD**:
  - Added Bandit (Python security analyzer) with SARIF upload to GitHub Security
  - Added Trivy (container/IaC scanner) for Docker image and Dockerfile analysis
  - Added pip-audit and npm-audit for dependency vulnerability scanning
  - Automatic GitHub issue creation for detected vulnerabilities
  - Security scan results visible in GitHub Security tab

### Enhanced
- **3D Model Viewer Improvements** (PR #262):
  - Added plate selector for multi-plate 3MF files with thumbnail previews
  - Object count display shows number of objects per plate and total
  - Fullscreen toggle for immersive model viewing
  - Resizable split view between plate selector and 3D viewer in fullscreen mode
  - Pagination support for files with many plates (e.g., 50+ plates)
  - Added i18n translations for all model viewer strings (English, German, Japanese)
- **Virtual Printer Proxy Mode Improvements**:
  - SSDP proxy for cross-network setups: select slicer network interface for automatic printer discovery via SSDP relay
  - FTP proxy now listens on privileged port 990 (matching Bambu Studio expectations) instead of 9990
  - For systemd: requires `AmbientCapabilities=CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE` capability
  - Automatic directory permission checking at startup with clear error messages for Docker/bare metal
  - Updated translations for proxy mode steps in English, German, and Japanese

### Fixed
- **Authentication Required Error After Initial Setup** (Issue #257):
  - Fixed "Authentication required" error when using printer controls after fresh install with auth enabled
  - Token clearing on 401 responses is now more selective - only clears on invalid token messages
  - Generic "Authentication required" errors (which may be timing issues) no longer clear the token
  - Also fixed smart plug discovery scan endpoints missing auth headers
- **Filament Hover Card Overlapping Navigation Bar** (Issue #259):
  - Fixed filament info popup being partially covered by the navigation bar
  - Hover card positioning now accounts for the fixed 56px header
  - Cards near the top of the page now correctly flip to show below the slot
- **Filament Statistics Incorrectly Multiplied by Quantity** (Issue #229):
  - Fixed filament totals being inflated by incorrectly multiplying by quantity
  - The `filament_used_grams` field already contains the total for the entire print job
  - Removed incorrect `* quantity` multiplication from archive stats, Prometheus metrics, and FilamentTrends chart
  - Example: A print with 26 objects using 126g was incorrectly shown as 3,276g
- **Print Queue Status Does Not Match Printer Status** (Issue #249):
  - Queue now shows "Paused" when the printer is paused instead of "Printing"
  - Fetches real-time printer state for actively printing queue items
  - Added translations for paused status in English, German, and Japanese
- **Queue Scheduled Time Displayed in Wrong Timezone** (Issue #233):
  - Fixed scheduled time being displayed in UTC instead of local timezone when editing queue items
  - The datetime picker now correctly shows and saves times in the user's local timezone
- **Mobile Layout Issues on Archives and Statistics Pages** (Issue #255):
  - Fixed header buttons overflowing outside the screen on iPhone/mobile devices
  - Headers now stack vertically on small screens with proper wrapping
  - Applied consistent responsive pattern from PrintersPage
- **AMS Auto-Matching Selects Wrong Slot** (Issue #245):
  - Fixed AMS slot mapping when multiple trays have the same `tray_info_idx` (filament type identifier)
  - `tray_info_idx` (e.g., "GFA00" for generic PLA) identifies filament TYPE, not unique spools
  - When multiple trays match the same type, color is now used as a tiebreaker
  - Previously used `find()` which always returned the first match regardless of color
  - Fixed in both backend (print_scheduler.py) and frontend (useFilamentMapping.ts)
  - Resolves wrong tray selection (e.g., A4 instead of B1) when multiple AMS units have same filament type
- **A1/A1 Mini FTP Upload Failures** (Issue #271):
  - Fixed FTP uploads hanging/timing out on A1 and A1 Mini printers
  - Replaced `storbinary()` with manual chunked transfer using `transfercmd()`
  - A1's FTP server has issues with Python's `storbinary()` waiting for completion response
  - Uses 1MB chunks with explicit 120s socket timeout for reliable transfers
  - Works for all printer models (X1C, P1S, P1P, A1, A1 Mini)
- **P1S/P1P FTP Upload Failures**:
  - Fixed FTP uploads failing with EOFError on P1S and P1P printers
  - These printers use vsFTPd which requires SSL session reuse on data channel
  - Removed P1S/P1P from skip-session-reuse list (they were incorrectly added)
- **FTP Auto-Detection for A1 Printers**:
  - Automatically detects working FTP mode (prot_p vs prot_c) for A1/A1 Mini
  - Tries encrypted data channel first, falls back to clear if needed
  - Caches working mode per printer IP to avoid repeated detection
- **Safari Camera Stream Failing**:
  - Fixed camera streams not loading in Safari due to Service Worker error
  - Safari has stricter Service Worker scope requirements
- **Queue Print Time for Multi-Plate Files** (PR #274):
  - Fixed print time showing total for all plates instead of selected plate
  - Now extracts per-plate print time from 3MF slice_info.config
  - Contributed by MisterBeardy
- **Docker Permissions**:
  - Added user directive to docker-compose.yml using PUID/PGID environment variables
  - Allows container to run as host user, fixing permission issues with bind-mounted volumes
  - Usage: `PUID=$(id -u) PGID=$(id -g) docker compose up -d`

### Added
- **Windows Portable Launcher** (contributed by nmori):
  - New `start_bambuddy.bat` for Windows users - double-click to run, no installation required
  - Automatically downloads Python 3.13 and Node.js 22 on first run (portable, no system changes)
  - Everything stored in `.portable\` folder for easy cleanup
  - Commands: `start_bambuddy.bat` (launch), `start_bambuddy.bat update` (update deps), `start_bambuddy.bat reset` (clean start)
  - Custom port via `set PORT=9000 & start_bambuddy.bat`
  - Verifies all downloads with SHA256 checksums for security
  - Supports both x64 and ARM64 Windows systems

## [0.1.7] - 2026-02-03

### Security
- **Critical: Missing API Endpoint Authentication** (CVE-2026-25505, CVSS 9.8):
  - Added authentication to 200+ API endpoints that were previously unprotected
  - All route files now use `RequirePermissionIfAuthEnabled()` for permission checks
  - Protected endpoints: archives, projects, settings, API keys, groups, cloud, notifications, maintenance, filaments, external links, smart plugs, discovery, firmware, camera, k-profiles, AMS history, pending uploads, updates, spoolman, system, print queue, printers
  - Image-serving endpoints (thumbnails, timelapse, photos, camera streams) remain public as they require knowing the resource ID and are loaded via `<img>` tags which cannot send Authorization headers
  - Backend integration tests added to verify endpoint authentication enforcement

### Enhancements
- **TOTP Authenticator Support for Bambu Cloud** (Issue #182):
  - Added support for TOTP-based two-factor authentication when connecting to Bambu Cloud
  - Accounts with authenticator apps (Google Authenticator, Authy, etc.) now work correctly
  - Proper detection of verification type: email code vs TOTP code
  - Uses browser-like headers to bypass Cloudflare protection on TFA endpoint
  - Frontend shows appropriate message for each verification type
  - Added translations for TOTP UI in English, German, and Japanese
- **Spoolman: Open in Spoolman Button** (Issue #210):
  - FilamentHoverCard now shows "Open in Spoolman" button when spool is already linked in Spoolman
  - Button links directly to the spool's page in Spoolman for quick editing
  - "Link to Spoolman" button now only shows when spool is not yet linked
  - Link button correctly disabled when no unlinked spools are available in Spoolman
  - Toast notification shown on successful/failed spool linking
  - Added `/api/v1/spoolman/spools/linked` endpoint returning map of linked spool tags to IDs
- **Complete German Translations**:
  - All UI strings now fully translated to German (1800+ translation keys)
  - Pages translated: Settings, Archives, File Manager, Queue, Printers, Profiles, Projects, Stats, Maintenance, Camera, Groups, Users, Login, Setup, Stream Overlay
  - Components translated: ConfirmModal, LinkSpoolModal, FilamentHoverCard, Layout
  - Added locale parity test to ensure English and German stay in sync
- **Virtual Printer Proxy Mode**:
  - New "Proxy" mode allows remote printing over any network by relaying slicer traffic to a real printer
  - Configure a target printer and Bambuddy acts as a TLS proxy between your slicer and the printer
  - Supports both FTP (port 9990) and MQTT (port 8883) protocols with full TLS encryption
  - Slicer connects to Bambuddy using the real printer's access code
  - Real-time status display showing active FTP/MQTT connections
  - Target printer selector with validation (must be configured in Bambuddy)
  - Proxy mode bypasses the access code requirement (uses the real printer's credentials)
  - Full i18n support for all proxy mode UI strings (English, German, Japanese)

### Fixed
- **Cannot Link Multiple HA Entities to Same Printer** (Issue #214):
  - Fixed Home Assistant entities being limited to one per printer
  - Both frontend and backend were blocking printers that already had any smart plug linked
  - Now only Tasmota plugs are limited to one per printer (physical device constraint)
  - Multiple HA entities (switches, scripts, lights, etc.) can be linked to the same printer
  - Restored "Show on Printer Card" toggle for HA entities to control visibility on printer cards
  - Fixed printer card only showing `script.*` entities; now shows all HA entities with toggle enabled
  - HA entities now default to auto_on=False and auto_off=False (appropriate for automations)
  - Printer cards now update immediately when HA entities are added/modified/deleted
- **Monthly Comparison Calculation Off** (Issue #229):
  - Fixed filament statistics not accounting for quantity multiplier
  - Monthly comparison chart now correctly multiplies `filament_used_grams` by `quantity`
  - Daily and weekly charts also now account for quantity
  - Filament type breakdown includes quantity in calculations
  - Backend stats endpoint (`/archives/stats`) and Prometheus metrics also fixed
  - Prints count now shows total items (sum of quantities) instead of archive count
- **Authentication Required for Downloads** (Issue #231):
  - Fixed support bundle download returning 401 Unauthorized when auth is enabled
  - Fixed archive export (CSV/XLSX) failing with authentication enabled
  - Fixed statistics export failing with authentication enabled
  - Fixed printer file ZIP download failing with authentication enabled
  - Root cause: These endpoints used raw `fetch()` without Authorization header
- **Queue Schedule Date Picker Ignores User Format Settings** (Issue #233):
  - Replaced native datetime picker with custom date/time inputs respecting user settings
  - Date input shows in user's format (DD/MM/YYYY for EU, MM/DD/YYYY for US, YYYY-MM-DD for ISO)
  - Time input shows in user's format (24H or 12H with AM/PM)
  - Calendar button opens native picker for convenience; selection is formatted to user's preference
  - Placeholder text shows expected format (e.g., "DD/MM/YYYY" or "HH:MM AM/PM")
  - Added date utilities: `formatDateInput`, `parseDateInput`, `getDatePlaceholder`
  - Added time utilities: `formatTimeInput`, `parseTimeInput`, `getTimePlaceholder`
- **500 Error on Archive Detail Page**:
  - Fixed internal server error when viewing individual archive details
  - Root cause: `project` relationship not eagerly loaded in `get_archive()` service method
  - Async SQLAlchemy requires explicit eager loading; lazy loading is not supported

## [0.1.6.2] - 2026-02-02

> **Security Release**: This release addresses critical security vulnerabilities. Users running authentication-enabled instances should upgrade immediately.

### Security
- **Critical: Hardcoded JWT Secret Key** (GHSA-gc24-px2r-5qmf, CWE-321) - Fixed hardcoded JWT secret key that could allow attackers to forge authentication tokens:
  - JWT secret now loaded from `JWT_SECRET_KEY` environment variable (recommended for production)
  - Falls back to auto-generated `.jwt_secret` file in data directory with secure permissions (0600)
  - Generates cryptographically secure 64-byte random secret if neither exists
  - **Action Required**: Existing users will need to re-login after upgrading
- **Critical: Missing API Authentication** (GHSA-gc24-px2r-5qmf, CWE-306) - Fixed 77+ API endpoints that lacked authentication checks:
  - Added HTTP middleware enforcing authentication on ALL `/api/` routes when auth is enabled
  - Only essential public endpoints are exempt (login, auth status, version check, WebSocket)
  - All other API calls now require valid JWT token or API key

### Enhancements
- **Location Filter for Queue** (Issue #220):
  - Filter queue jobs by printer location in the Queue page
  - "Any {Model}" queue assignments can now specify a target location (e.g., "Any X1C in Workshop")
  - Location filter dropdown shows all unique locations from printers and queue items
  - Location is saved with queue items and displayed in the queue list
- **Ownership-Based Permissions** (Issue #205):
  - Users can now only update/delete their own items unless they have elevated permissions
  - Update/delete permissions split into `*_own` and `*_all` variants:
    - `queue:update_own` / `queue:update_all`
    - `queue:delete_own` / `queue:delete_all`
    - `archives:update_own` / `archives:update_all`
    - `archives:delete_own` / `archives:delete_all`
    - `archives:reprint_own` / `archives:reprint_all`
    - `library:update_own` / `library:update_all`
    - `library:delete_own` / `library:delete_all`
  - Administrators group gets `*_all` permissions (can modify any items)
  - Operators group gets `*_own` permissions (can only modify their own items)
  - Ownerless items (legacy data without creator) require `*_all` permission
  - Bulk operations skip items user doesn't have permission to modify
  - User deletion now offers choice: delete user's items or keep them (become ownerless)
  - Backend enforces permissions on all API endpoints (not just frontend UI)
  - Automatic migration upgrades existing groups to new permission model
- **User Tracking for Archives, Library & Queue** (Issue #206):
  - Track and display who uploaded each archive file
  - Track and display who uploaded each library file (File Manager)
  - Track and display who added each print job to the queue
  - Shows username on archive cards, library files, queue items, and printer cards (while printing)
  - Works when authentication is enabled; gracefully hidden when auth is disabled
  - Database migration adds `created_by_id` columns to `print_archives`, `library_files`, and `print_queue` tables
- **Separate AMS RFID Permission** (Issue #204):
  - Added new `printers:ams_rfid` permission for re-reading AMS RFID tags
  - Allows granting RFID re-read access without full printer control permissions
  - Operators group includes this permission by default
  - Available in Settings > Users > Group Editor as a toggleable permission
- **Schedule Button on Archive Cards** (Issue #208):
  - Added "Schedule" button next to "Reprint" on archive cards for quick access to print scheduling
  - Previously only available in the context menu (right-click)
  - Respects `queue:create` permission for users with restricted access
- **Streaming Overlay Improvements** (Issue #164):
  - **Configurable FPS**: Add `?fps=30` parameter to control camera frame rate (1-30, default 15)
  - **Status-only mode**: Add `?camera=false` parameter to hide camera and show only status overlay on black background
  - Increased default camera FPS from 10 to 15 for smoother video across all camera views
- **Simplified Backup/Restore System**:
  - Complete backup now creates a single ZIP file containing the entire database and all data directories
  - Includes: database, archives, library files, thumbnails, timelapses, icons, projects, and plate calibration data
  - Portable backups: works across different installations and data directories
  - Faster backup/restore: direct file copy instead of JSON export/import
  - Progress indicator and navigation blocking during backup/restore operations
  - Removed ~2000 lines of legacy JSON-based backup/restore code

### Fixes
- **File Manager permissions not enforced** (Issue #224) - Fixed backend not checking `library:read` permission for File Manager endpoints:
  - Added `library:read` permission check to all list/view endpoints (files, folders, stats)
  - Added `library:upload` permission check to upload and folder creation endpoints
  - Added `queue:create` permission check to add-to-queue endpoint
  - Added `printers:control` permission check to direct print endpoint
  - Added ownership-based permission checks to file move operation
  - Users without `library:read` permission can no longer view files in the File Manager
  - Users can now only delete/update their own files unless they have `*_all` permissions
- **JWT secret key not persistent across restarts** - Fixed JWT secret key generation to properly use data directory, ensuring tokens remain valid across container restarts
- **Images/thumbnails returning 401 when auth enabled** - Fixed auth middleware to allow public access to image/media endpoints (thumbnails, photos, QR codes, timelapses, camera streams) since browser elements like `<img>` don't send Authorization headers
- **Library thumbnails missing after restore** - Fixed library files using absolute paths that break after restore on different systems:
  - Library now stores relative paths in database for portability
  - Automatic migration converts existing absolute paths to relative on startup
  - Thumbnails and files now display correctly after restoring backups
- **File uploads failing with authentication enabled** - Fixed all file upload functions (archives, photos, timelapses, library files, etc.) not sending authentication headers when auth is enabled
- **External spool AMS mapping causing "Failed to get AMS mapping table"** (Issue #213) - Fixed external spool `ams_mapping2` slot_id handling that caused AMS mapping failures
- **Filename matching for files with spaces** (Issue #218) - Fixed file detection when filenames contain spaces
- **P2S FTP upload failure** (Issue #218) - Fixed FTP uploads to P2S printers by passing `skip_session_reuse` to ImplicitFTP_TLS
- **Printer deletion freeze** (Issue #214) - Fixed UI freeze when deleting printers, and now allows multiple smart plugs per printer
- **Stack trace exposure in error responses** (CodeQL Alert #68) - Fixed stack traces being exposed in API error responses in archives.py
- **Printer serial numbers exposed in support bundle** (Issue #216) - Sanitized printer serial numbers in support bundle logs for privacy
- **Missing sliced_for_model migration** (Issue #211) - Fixed database migration for `sliced_for_model` column that was missing in some upgrade paths

  - Queue now displays the correct plate thumbnail based on selected plate
  - Previously always showed plate 1 thumbnail regardless of selection
- **A1/A1 Mini Shows Printing Instead of Idle** - Fixed incorrect status display for A1 series printers (Issue #168):
  - Some A1/A1 Mini firmware versions incorrectly report stage 0 ("Printing") when idle
  - Now checks gcode_state to correctly display "Idle" for affected printers
  - Fix only applies to A1 models with the specific buggy condition
- **HMS Error Notifications** - Get notified when printer errors occur (Issue #84):

- **P2S Empty Archive Tiles** - Fixed FTP file search for printers without SD card (Issue #146):
  - Added root folder `/` to search paths when looking for 3MF files
  - Printers without SD card store files in root instead of `/cache`
- **Empty AMS Slot Not Recognized** - Fixed bug where removed spools still appeared in Bambuddy (Issue #147):
  - Old AMS: Now properly applies empty values from tray data updates
  - New AMS (AMS 2 Pro): Now checks `tray_exist_bits` bitmask to detect and clear empty slots
- **Reprint Cost Tracking** - Reprinting an archive now adds the cost to the existing total, so statistics accurately reflect total filament expenditure across all prints

- **GitHub Backup Timestamps** - Removed volatile timestamps from GitHub backup files so git diffs only show actual data changes
- **Model-Based Queue AMS Mapping** - Fixed "Any [Model]" queue jobs failing at filament loading on H2D Pro and other printers (Issue #192):
  - Scheduler now computes AMS mapping after printer assignment for model-based jobs
  - Previously, no AMS mapping was sent because the specific printer wasn't known at queue time
