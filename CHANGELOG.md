### Fixes
- **Multi-Plate Thumbnail in Queue** - Fixed queue items showing wrong thumbnail for multi-plate files (Issue #166):
  - Queue now displays the correct plate thumbnail based on selected plate
  - Previously always showed plate 1 thumbnail regardless of selection
- **A1/A1 Mini Shows Printing Instead of Idle** - Fixed incorrect status display for A1 series printers (Issue #168):
  - Some A1/A1 Mini firmware versions incorrectly report stage 0 ("Printing") when idle
  - Now checks gcode_state to correctly display "Idle" for affected printers
  - Fix only applies to A1 models with the specific buggy condition
- **HMS Error Notifications** - Get notified when printer errors occur (Issue #84):
  - Automatic notifications for HMS errors (AMS issues, nozzle problems, etc.)
  - Human-readable error messages (853 error codes translated)
  - Friendly error type names (Print/Task, AMS/Filament, Nozzle/Extruder, Motion Controller, Chamber)
  - Deduplication prevents spam from repeated error messages
  - Publishes to MQTT relay for home automation integrations
  - New "Printer Error" toggle in notification provider settings
- **Plate Calibration Persistence** - Fixed plate detection reference images not persisting after restart in Docker deployments
- **Telegram Notification Parsing** - Fixed Telegram markdown parsing errors when messages contain underscores (e.g., error codes)
- **Settings API PATCH Method** - Added PATCH support to `/api/settings` for Home Assistant rest_command compatibility (Issue #152)
- **P2S Empty Archive Tiles** - Fixed FTP file search for printers without SD card (Issue #146):
  - Added root folder `/` to search paths when looking for 3MF files
  - Printers without SD card store files in root instead of `/cache`
- **Empty AMS Slot Not Recognized** - Fixed bug where removed spools still appeared in Bambuddy (Issue #147):
  - Old AMS: Now properly applies empty values from tray data updates
  - New AMS (AMS 2 Pro): Now checks `tray_exist_bits` bitmask to detect and clear empty slots
- **Reprint Cost Tracking** - Reprinting an archive now adds the cost to the existing total, so statistics accurately reflect total filament expenditure across all prints
- **HA Energy Sensors Not Detected** - Home Assistant energy sensors with lowercase units (w, kwh) are now properly detected; unit matching is now case-insensitive (Issue #119)
- **File Manager Upload** - Upload modal now accepts all file types, not just ZIP files
- **Camera Zoom & Pan Improvements** - Enhanced camera viewer zoom/pan functionality (Issue #132):
  - Pan range now based on actual container size, allowing full navigation of zoomed image
  - Added pinch-to-zoom support for mobile/touch devices
  - Added touch-based panning when zoomed in
  - Both embedded camera viewer and standalone camera page updated
- **Progress Milestone Time** - Fixed milestone notifications showing wrong time (e.g., "17m" instead of "17h 47m") by converting remaining_time from minutes to seconds (Issue #157)
- **File Manager Folder Navigation** - Improved handling of long folder names (Issue #160):
  - Resizable sidebar: Drag the edge to adjust width (200-500px), double-click to reset
  - Text wrap toggle: "Wrap" button in header to wrap long names instead of truncating
  - Both settings persist in localStorage
  - Tooltip shows full name on hover
- **K-Profiles Backup Status** - Fixed GitHub backup settings showing incorrect printer connection count (e.g., "1/2 connected" when both printers are connected); now fetches status from API instead of relying on WebSocket cache
- **GitHub Backup Timestamps** - Removed volatile timestamps from GitHub backup files so git diffs only show actual data changes
- **Model-Based Queue AMS Mapping** - Fixed "Any [Model]" queue jobs failing at filament loading on H2D Pro and other printers (Issue #192):
  - Scheduler now computes AMS mapping after printer assignment for model-based jobs
  - Previously, no AMS mapping was sent because the specific printer wasn't known at queue time
  - Auto-matches required filaments to available AMS slots by type and color

### Maintenance
- Upgraded vitest from 2.x to 3.x to resolve npm audit security vulnerabilities in dev dependencies

## [0.1.6b11] - 2026-01-22

  - Energy sensor dropdowns (Power, Energy Today, Total) are now searchable
  - Find sensors with non-standard naming that don't match the switch entity name
- **Home Assistant Energy Sensor Support** - HA smart plugs can now use separate sensor entities for energy monitoring:
  - Configure dedicated power sensor (W), today's energy (kWh), and total energy (kWh) sensors
  - Supports plugs where energy data is exposed as separate sensor entities (common with Tapo, IKEA Zigbee2mqtt, etc.)
  - Energy sensors are selectable from all available HA sensors with power/energy units
  - Falls back to switch entity attributes if no sensors configured
  - Print energy tracking now works correctly for HA plugs (not just Tasmota)
  - New API endpoint: `GET /api/v1/smart-plugs/ha/sensors` to list available energy sensors
- **Finish Photo in Notifications** - Camera snapshot URL available in notification templates (Issue #126):
  - New `{finish_photo_url}` template variable for print_complete, print_failed, print_stopped events
  - Photo is captured before notification is sent (ensures image is available)
  - New "External URL" setting in Settings → Network (auto-detects from browser)
  - Full URL constructed for external notification services (Telegram, Email, Discord, etc.)
- **ZIP File Support in File Manager** - Upload and extract ZIP files directly in the library (Issue #121):
  - Drop or select ZIP files to automatically extract contents
  - Option to preserve folder structure from ZIP or extract flat
  - Extracts thumbnails and metadata from 3MF/gcode files inside ZIP
  - Progress indicator shows number of files extracted

### Fixed
- **Print time stats using slicer estimates** - Quick Stats "Print Time" now uses actual elapsed time (`completed_at - started_at`) instead of slicer estimates; cancelled prints only count time actually printed (Issue #137)
- **Skip objects modal overflow** - Modal now has max height (85vh) with scrollable object list when printing many items on the bed (Issue #134)
- **Filament cost using wrong default** - Statistics now correctly uses the "Default filament cost (per kg)" setting instead of hardcoded €25 value (Issue #120)
- **Spoolman tag field not auto-created** - The required "tag" extra field is now automatically created in Spoolman on first connect, fixing sync failures for fresh Spoolman installs (Issue #123)
- **P2S/X1E/H2 completion photo not captured** - Internal model codes (N7, C13, O1D, etc.) from MQTT/SSDP are now recognized for RTSP camera support (Issue #127)
- **Mattermost/Slack webhook 400 error** - Added "Slack / Mattermost" payload format option that sends `{"text": "..."}` instead of custom fields (Issue #133)
- **Subnet scan serial number** - Fixed A1 Mini subnet discovery showing "unknown-*" placeholder; serial field is now cleared so users know to enter it manually (Issue #140)
